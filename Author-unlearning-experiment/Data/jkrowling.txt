CHAPTER ONE
OWL POST
Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he
hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,
he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,
in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the
blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand
and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot)
propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his
eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something
that would help him write his essay, "Witch Burning in the Fourteenth
Century Was Completely Pointless discuss."
The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed
his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer
to the book, and read:
Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly
afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.
On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning
had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic
Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying
a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being
burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than
fortyseven times in various disguises.
Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow
for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he
unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write,
pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys
heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'd
probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the
rest of the summer.
The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that
Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and
2
their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. They were
Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry's
dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never
mentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle
Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible,
they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they
had been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding
out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lock
away Harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of
the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.
One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was
for Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be
delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry
had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front
garden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car (in very loud voices, so
that the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept
downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed
some of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn't
leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he
was studying magic by night.
Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at
the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all
because he'd received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week
into the school vacation.
Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came from
a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry
didn't, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had
been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.
"Vernon Dursley speaking."
Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard
Ron's voice answer.
3
"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -- TO --
HARRY
-- POTTER!"
Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver
a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled
fury and alarm.
"WHO IS THIS?" he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. "WHO ARE
YOU?"
"RON -- WEASLEY!" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were
speaking from opposite ends of a football field. "I'M -- A -- FRIEND --
OF -- HARRY'S -- FROM -- SCHOOL --"
Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to
the spot.
"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!" he roared, now holding the receiver
at
arm's length, as though frightened it might explode. "I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN!
DON'T YOU COME NEAR
MY FAMILY!"
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.
The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
"HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE -- PEOPLE LIKE
YOU!" Uncle
Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he'd gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn't called again. Harry's other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn't been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had
warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the
cleverest witch in Harry's year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well
4
how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to
say that she went to Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long
weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last
one. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that he
wouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been
allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in
because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the
time.
Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen
again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,
grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,
Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he'd finish
this essay tomorrow night....
He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from
under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill,
and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose
floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the
time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.
It was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He
had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward
to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The
Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no
reason to suppose they would remember this one.
Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to
the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on
his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent
for two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her: she'd been gone this
long before. But he hoped she'd be back soon -- she was the only living
creature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it
5
always had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes
behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly
visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of
lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most
extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten
years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents,
because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been
murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years,
Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more
than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort's curse, instead of killing
him, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had
fled....
But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their
last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was
lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.
He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring
back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise.
Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry
realized what he was seeing.
Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,
was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry's
direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a
split second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering
whether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one
of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was,
leapt aside.
Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,
which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on
Harry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right
over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- his name was Errol, and
he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the
6
cords around Errol's legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol
to Hedwig's cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of
thanks, and began to gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked
extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with
her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join
Errol.
Harry didn't recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package,
it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved
this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched
its wings, and took off through the window into the night.
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol's package, ripped off the
brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first
ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope.
Two pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping.
The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily
Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving.
Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:
MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE
Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the
Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon
Draw.
A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, "We will be spending the
gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as
a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank."
The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the
start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley
children currently attend.
Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face
7
as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in
front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tail, balding Mr.
Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white
picture didn't show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of
the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on
his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.
Harry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold
more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He picked
up Ron's letter and unfolded it.
Dear Harry,
Happy birthday!
Look, I' really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles
didn't give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn't
have shouted.
It's amazing here in Egypt. Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you
wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum
wouldn't let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant
skeletons in there, of Muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads and
stuff.
I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred
galleons! Most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me a
new wand for next year.
Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron's old wand had
snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to
Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.
We'll be back about a week before term starts and we'll be going up to
London to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting you
there?
Don't let the Muggles get you down!
Try and come to London,
8
Ron
P.S. Percy's Head Boy. He got the letter last week.
Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and
final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his
Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his
horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.
Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked
like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron
beneath it.
Harry -- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it's rubbish sold
for wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up at
dinner last night. But he didn't realize Fred and George had put beetles
in his soup.
Bye --
Ron
Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood
quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his
clock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the
parcel Hedwig had brought.
Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter,
this time from Hermione.
Dear Harry,
Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I
do hope you're all right.
I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going
to send this to you -- what if they'd opened it at customs? -- but then
Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for
9
your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there
was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I've been getting it
delivered; it's so good to keep up with what's going on in the wizarding
world), Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet
he's learning loads. I'm really jealous -- the ancient Egyptian wizards
were fascinating.
There's some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I've
rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things
I've found out, I hope it's not too long -- it's two rolls of parchment
more than Professor Binns asked for.
Ron says he's going to be in London in the last week of the holidays.
Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope
you can. If not, I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September
first!
Love from Hermione
P.S. Ron says Percy's Head Boy. I'll bet Percy's really pleased Ron
doesn't seem too happy about it
Harry laughed as he put Herrmone's letter aside and picked up her
present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a
large book full of very difficult spells -- but it wasn't. His heart
gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black
leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick
Servicing Kit.
"Wow, Hermione!" Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
There was a large jar of Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair
of gleaming silver Tall-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on
your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself
Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world -- highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to
be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a
10
century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry's
most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it
snapped loudly -- as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous
on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of what
was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon
eggs into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and
raised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the
wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.
And out fell -- a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome
green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of
Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along
the bed like some weird crab.
"Uh-oh," Harry muttered.
The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly
across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in
the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast
asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.
"Ouch!"
The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still
scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward,
and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the
room next door.
11
Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling
book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled
out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book
shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it
down on the bed and reached for Hagrid's card.
Dear Harry,
Happy Birthday!
Think you might find this useful for next year. Won't say no more here.
Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right.
All the best,
Hagrid
It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come
in useful, but he put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's,
grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from
Hogwarts left.
Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the
envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:
Dear Mr. Potter,
Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first.
The Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King's Cross station, platform nine
and three-quarters, at eleven o'clock.
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain
weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or
guardian to sign.
A list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely,
Professor M. McGonagall
Deputy Headmistress
12
Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no
longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends;
he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot
there. But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt
Petunia to sign the form?
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o'clock in the
morning.
Deciding that he'd worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry
got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart
he'd made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to
Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing
his three birthday cards.
Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just
like everyone else -- glad, for the first time in his life, that it was
his birthday.
CHAPTER TWO
AUNT MARGE'S BIG MISTAKE
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys
already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new
television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had
been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the
television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in
the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five
chins wobbling as he ate continually.
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with
very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy
birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry
enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped
himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the
television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:
"... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A
13
special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be
reported immediately."
"No need to tell us he's no good," snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over
the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. "Look at the state of him, the
filthy layabout! Look at his hair!"
He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always
been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on
the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted,
elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.
The reporter had reappeared.
"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --"
"Hang on!" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. "You
didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! \What use is that?
Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!"
Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered
intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply
love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest
woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring,
law-abiding neighbors.
"When will they learn," said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his
large purple fist, "that hanging's the only way to deal with these
people?"
"Very true," said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's
runner beans.
Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, "I'd
better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten."
Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing
Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.
"Aunt Marge?" he blurted out. "Sh -- she's not coming here, is she?"
14
Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she was not a blood
relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), he
had been forced to call her "Aunt" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the
country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She
didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leave
her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in
Harry's mind.
At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around
the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at
musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with
a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On
her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had
accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased
Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to
call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still
brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.
"Marge'll be here for a week," Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we're
on the subject" -- he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- "we
need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her."
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry
being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form of
entertainment.
"Firstly," growled Uncle Vernon, "you'll keep a civil tongue in your
head when you're talking to Marge."
"All right," said Harry bitterly, "if she does when she's talking to me.
"Secondly," said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's
reply, "as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't
want any -- any funny stuff while she's here.
You behave yourself, got me?"
"I will if she does," said Harry through gritted teeth.
15
"And thirdly," said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his
great purple face, "we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure
Center for Incurably Criminal Boys."
"What?" Harry yelled.
"And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spat
Uncle Vernon.
Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon,
hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it
was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,
including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
"Well, Petunia," said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, "I'll
be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?"
"No," said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now
that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.
"Duddy's got to make himself smart for his auntie," said Aunt Petunia,
smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. "Mummy's bought him a lovely new
bow tie."
Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. "See you in a bit,
then," he said, and he left the kitchen.
Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden
idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed
Uncle Vernon to the front door.
Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.
"I'm not taking you," he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.
"Like I wanted to come," said Harry coldly. "I want to ask you
something."
Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.
16
"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village
sometimes," said Harry.
"So?" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the
door.
"I need you to sign the permission form," said Harry in a rush.
"And why should I do that?" sneered Uncle Vernon.
"Well," said Harry, choosing his words carefully, "it'll be hard work,
pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --"
"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!" bellowed Uncle
Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle
Vernon's voice.
"Exactly," said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large,
purple face. "It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound
convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?"
"You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?" roared Uncle
Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his
ground.
"Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I
could tell her," he said grimly.
Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.
"But if you sign my permission form," Harry went on quickly, "I swear
I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a
Mug -- like I'm normal and everything."
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his
teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.
"Right," he snapped finally. "I shall monitor your behavior carefully
during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and
kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form."
17
He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard
that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.
Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his
bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he'd better start
now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday
cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he
went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig
were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them
both awake.
"Hedwig," he said gloomily, "you're going to have to clear off for a
week. Go with Errol. Ron'll look after you. I'll write him a note,
explaining. And don't look at me like that" -- Hedwig's large amber eyes
were reproachful -- "it's not my fault. It's the only way I'll be
allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione."
Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her
leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling
thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.
But Harry didn't have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia
was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to
welcome their guest.
"Do something about your hair!" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the
hall.
Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt
Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she
would be.
All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon's car
pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and
footsteps on the garden path.
"Get the door!" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.
A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.
18
On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon:
large, beefy, and purple- faced, she even had a mustache, though not as
bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked
under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.
"Where's my Dudders?" roared Aunt Marge. "Where's my neffy-poo?"
Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his
fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust
the suitcase into Harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized
Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge's hugs
because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart,
Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.
"Petunia!" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a
hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge
bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia's bony cheekbone.
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.
"Tea, Marge?" he said. "And what will Ripper take?"
"Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer," said Aunt Marge as they all
proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the
suitcase. But Harry wasn't complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt
Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the
spare bedroom, taking as long as he could.
By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied
with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner.
Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked
her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.
"Who's looking after the other dogs, Marge?" Uncle Vernon asked.
"Oh, I've got Colonel Fubster managing them," boomed Aunt Marge. "He's
retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn't leave
19
poor old Ripper. He pines if he's away from me."
Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt
Marge's attention to Harry for the first time.
"So!" she barked. "Still here, are you?"
"Yes," said Harry.
"Don't you say yes' in that ungrateful tone," Aunt Marge growled. "It's
damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn't have done it
myself. You'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped on
my doorstep."
Harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage than
with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He
forced his face into a painful smile.
"Don't you smirk at me!" boomed Aunt Marge. "I can see you haven't
improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners
into you." She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said,
"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?"
"St. Brutus's," said Uncle Vernon promptly. "It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases."
"I see," said Aunt Marge. "Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?"
she barked across the table.
"Er --"
Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back.
"Yes," said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly,
he added, "all the time."
"Excellent," said Aunt Marge. "I won't have this namby-pamby,
wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good
thrashing is what's needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have
you been beaten often?"
20
"Oh, yeah," said Harry, "loads of times."
Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.
"I still don't like your tone, boy," she said. "If you can speak of your
beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hard
enough. Petunia, I'd write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve
the use of extreme force in this boy's case."
Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain;
in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.
"Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner,
eh?"
As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself
thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their
way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other
hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom
out suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry
with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents
while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn't got a
present too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry
such an unsatisfactory person.
"You mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out, Vernon,"
she said over lunch on the third day. "If there's something rotten on
the inside, there's nothing anyone can do about it."
Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face
was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himself
Think about Hogsmeade. Don't say anything. Don't rise
Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.
"It's one of the basic rules of breeding," she said. "You see it all the
time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be
something wrong with the pup --"
21
At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her
hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered
and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.
"Marge!" squealed Aunt Petunia. "Marge, are you all right?"
"Not to worry," grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin.
"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster's
the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip..."
But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry
suspiciously, so he decided he'd better skip dessert and escape from the
table as soon as he could.
Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had
been a long time since he'd lost control and made something explode. He
couldn't afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn't the
only thing at stake -- if he carried on like that, he'd be in trouble
with the Ministry of Magic.
Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law
to do magic outside school. His record wasn't exactly clean either. Only
last summer he'd gotten an official warning that had stated quite
clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive,
Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.
He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the
way.
Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about
his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on
him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look,
because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally
subnormal.
At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge's stay arrived. Aunt
Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles
of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a
single mention of Harry's faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle
22
Vernon bored them A with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making
company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a
bottle of brandy.
"Can I tempt you, Marge?"
Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very
red.
"Just a small one, then," she chuckled. "A bit more than that... and a
bit more... that's the ticket."
Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping
coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to
disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes
and knew he would have to sit it out.
"Aah," said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy
glass back down. "Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up
for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after...." She burped
richly and patted her great tweed stomach. "Pardon me. But I do like to
see a healthy-sized boy," she went on, winking at Dudley. "You'll be a
proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I'll have a spot more
brandy, Vernon...."
"Now, this one here --"
She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook,
he thought quickly.
"This one's got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I
had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was-
Weak. Underbred."
Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure
Reluctant Reversers. "It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the
other day.
Bad blood will out. Now, I'm saying nothing against your family,
Petunia" she patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her shovellike one
23
"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then
she ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us."
Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your
broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn't remember what came
next. Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle
Vernon's drills.
"This Potter, 5) said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and
splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, "you never told
me what he did?"
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had
even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.
"He -- didn't work," said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry.
"Unemployed."
"As I expected!" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and
wiping her chin on her sleeve. "A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy
scrounger who --"
"He was not," said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was
shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.
"MORE BRANDY!" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied
the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. "You, boy," he snarled at Harry. "Go
to bed, go on --"
"No, Vernon," hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot
eyes fixed on Harry's. "Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are
you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect)
--"
'They didn't die in a car crash!" said Harry, who found himself on his
feet.
"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a
burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!" screamed Aunt Marge,
swelling with fury. "You are an insolent, ungrateful little --"
24
But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as
though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with
inexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red face
started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too
tightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from
her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like a
monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband,
each of her fingers blowing up like a salami --
"MARGE!" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's
whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was
entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her
hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making
apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking
madly.
"NOOOOOOO!"
Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her down
again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later,
Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg.
Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading
for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically
open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front
door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up
the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and
birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, and
dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of
the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.
"COME BACK IN HERE!" he bellowed. "COME BACK AND PUT HER
RIGHT!"
But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open,
pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.
"She deserved it," Harry said, breathing very fast. "She deserved what
she got. You keep away from me."
25
He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.
"I'm going," Harry said. "I've had enough."
And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving
his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig's cage under his arm.
CHAPTER THREE
THE KNIGHT BUS
Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in
Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat
quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic
thumping of his heart.
But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook
him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse
fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with
absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done
serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from
Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage
Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives
weren't swooping down on him where he sat.
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.
What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he
simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and
Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal
or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both
abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.
He didn't have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold
in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune
his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding
Bank in London. He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to
London. Unless...
26
He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If
he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a
bit more magic couldn't hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had
inherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make it
feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak,
and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his
vault and... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect,
but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to
explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a
trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.
Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for
the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up
suddenly, looking around him once more.
A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was
being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights
shone from any of the large square houses.
He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more,
his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it:
someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage
and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only
it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or --
something else.
"Lumos," Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand,
almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the
pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door
gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking
outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.
Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand
flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he
landed, hard, in the gutter --
There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his
eyes against a sudden blinding light --
With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second
27
later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt
exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw
when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which
had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled
The Knight Bus.
For a Split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his
fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and
began to speak loudly to the night.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch
or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board) and we can take
you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this eve --"
The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of "Harry, who
was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and
scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a
few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large,
protruding ears and quite a few pimples.
"What were you doin' down there?" said Stan, dropping his professional
manner.
"Fell over," said Harry.
"'Choo fall over for?" sniggered Stan.
"I didn't do it on purpose," said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in
his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was
bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned
around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence.
The Knight Bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was
empty.
"'Choo lookin' at?" said Stan.
"There was a big black thing," said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the
gap. "Like a dog... but massive..."
28
He looked a-round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling
of unease, Harry saw Stan's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead.
"Woss that on your 'ead?" said Stan abruptly.
"Nothing," said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the
Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn't want to make it too
easy for them.
"Woss your name?" Stan persisted.
"Neville Longbottom," said Harry, saying the first name that came into
his head. "So -- so this bus," he went on quickly, hoping to distract
Stan, "did you say it goes anywhere?"
"Yep," said Stan proudly, "anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't
do nuffink underwater. 'Ere," he said, looking suspicious again, ,You
did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand 'and, dincha?"
"Yes," said Harry quickly. "Listen, how much would it be to get to
London?"
"Eleven Sickles," said Stan, "but for fifteen you get 'or chocolate, and
for fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color of
your choice."
Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and
shoved some gold into Stan's hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk,
with Hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.
There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside
the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,
illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the
rear of the bus muttered, "Not now, thanks, I'm pickling some slugs" and
rolled over in his sleep.
"You 'ave this one," Stan whispered, shoving Harry's trunk under the bed
right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the
steering wheel. "This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This ,is Neville
Longbottom, Ern. "
29
Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to
Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.
"Take 'er away, Ern," said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to
Ernie's.
There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found
himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus.
Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that
they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was
watching Harry's stunned face with great enjoyment.
"This is where we was before you flagged us down," he said. "Where are
we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?"
"Ar," said Ernie.
"How come the Muggles don't hear the bus?" said Harry.
"Them!" said Stan contemptuously. "Don' listen properly, do they? Don'
look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'."
"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan," said Ern. "We'll be in Abergavenny
in a minute."
Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase.
Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous.
Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The
Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; lines
of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it
approached and back into position once it had passed.
Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in
a traveling cloak.
"'Ere you go, Madam Marsh," said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the
brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam
Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps.
Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was
30
another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane,
trees leaping out of the way.
Harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on
a bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a
time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to
happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge
off the ceiling yet.
Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with
his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man
with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He
looked strangely familiar.
"That man!" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. "He was on
the Muggle news!"
Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.
"Sirius Black," he said, nodding. "'Course 'e was on the Muggle news,
Neville, where you been?"
He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face,
removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.
"You oughta read the papers more, Neville."
Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:
BLACK STILL AT LARGE
Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in
Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic
confirmed today.
"We are doing all we can to recapture Black," said the Minister of
Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, "and we beg the magical community
to remain calm."
Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International
31
Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the
crisis.
"Well, really, I had to, don't you know," said an irritable Fudge.
"Black is mad. He's a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle.
I have the Prime Minister's assurance that he will not breathe a word of
Black's true identity to anyone. And let's face it-who'd believe him if
he did?"
While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of
metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community
lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black
murdered thirteen people with a single curse.
Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of
the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he
had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes,
and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.
"Scary-lookin' fing, inee?" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.
"He murdered thirteen people?" said Harry, handing the page back to
Stan, "with one curse?"
"Yep," said Stan, "in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big
trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?"
"Ar," said Ern darkly.
Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look
at Harry.
"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo," he said.
"What, Voldemort?" said Harry, without thinking.
Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard
that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.
"You outta your tree?" yelped Stan. "'Choo say 'is name for?"
32
"Sorry," said Harry hastily. "Sorry, I -- I forgot --"
"Forgot!" said Stan weakly. "Blimey, my 'eart's goin' that fast ..."
"So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?" Harry prompted
apologetically.
"Yeah," said Stan, still rubbing his chest. "Yeah, that's right. Very
close to You-Know-'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little 'Arry Potter got
the better of You-Know-'Oo --"
Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.
"-- all You-Know-'Oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't they, Ern?
Most of 'em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-'Oo gone, and they came
quiet. But not Sirius Black. I 'eard he thought 'e'd be
second-in-command once You-Know-'Oo 'ad taken over.
"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles
an' Black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, an' a
wizard got it, an' so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. 'Orrible,
eh? An' you know what Black did then?" Stan continued in a dramatic
whisper.
"What?" said Harry.
"Laughed," said Stan. "Jus' stood there an' laughed. An' when
reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, I 'e went wiv em
quiet as anyfink, still laughing 'is 'ead off. 'Cos 'e's mad, inee, Ern?
Inee mad?"
"If he weren't when he went to Azkaban, he will be now," said Ern in his
slow voice. "I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves
him right, mind you ... after what he did...."
"They 'ad a job coverin' it up, din' they, Ern?" Stan said. "'Ole street
blown up an' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad 'appened,
Ern?"
33
"Gas explosion," grunted Ernie.
"An' now 'e's out," said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of
Black's gaunt face again. "Never been a breakout from Azkaban before,
'as there, Ern? Beats me 'ow 'e did it. Frightenin', eh? Mind, I don't
fancy 'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?"
Ernie suddenly shivered.
"Talk about summat else, Stan, there's a good lad. Them Azkaban guards
give me the collywobbles."
Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window
of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn't help imagining
what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights' time.
"'Ear about that 'Arry Potter? Blew up 'is aunt! We 'ad 'im 'ere on the
Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? 'E was tryin' I to run for it...."
He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating
Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anything
about the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it did
so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent
two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of
terror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, and
Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.
The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and
wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and
miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry
had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when
the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards
and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper
floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.
Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.
"Right then, Neville," said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in
London?"
34
"Diagon Alley," said Harry.
"Righto," said Stan. "'Old tight, then."
BANG.
They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched
buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way.
The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of
hours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he
didn't know.
Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front
of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay
the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.
"Thanks," Harry said to Ern.
He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's
cage onto the pavement.
"Well," said Harry. "'Bye then!"
But Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the
bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
"There you are, Harry," said a voice.
Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same
time, Stan shouted, "Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere I"
Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a
bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.
Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.
"What didja call Neville, Minister?" he said excitedly.
Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and
exhausted.
35
"Neville?" he repeated, frowning. "This is Harry Potter."
"I knew it!" Stan shouted gleefully. "Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is,
Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar!"
"Yes," said Fudge testily, "well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked
Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now..."
Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found
himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a
lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the
wizened, toothless landlord.
"You've got him, Minister!" said Tom. "Will you be wanting anything?
Beer? Brandy?"
"Perhaps a pot of tea," said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.
There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern
appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around
excitedly.
"'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?" said Stan,
beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over
Stan's shoulder.
"And a private parlor, please, Tom," said Fudge pointedly.
`Bye," Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward
the passage that led from the bar.
"'Bye, Neville!" called Stan.
Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and
then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into
life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.
"Sit down, Harry," said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.
36
Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow
of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside,
then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down
opposite Harry.
"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic."
Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but
as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time,
Fudge wasn't to know that.
Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and
bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table
between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind
him.
"Well, Harry," said Fudge, pouring out tea, "you've had us all in a
right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and
uncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, and
that's what matters."
Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.
"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased
to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss
Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal
Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley
has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no
recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done."
Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle
surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears,
opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed
it again.
"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?" said
Fudge. "Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but
they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at
Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays."
37
Harry unstuck his throat.
"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays," he
said, "and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive."
"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,"
said Fudge in a worried tone. "They are your family, after all, and I'm
sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down."
It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to
hear what was going to happen to him now.
"So all that remains," said Fudge, now buttering himself a second
crumpet, "is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks of
your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and
"Hang on," blurted Harry. "What about my punishment?"
Fudge blinked. "Punishment?"
"I broke the law!" Harry said. "The Decree for the Restriction of
Underage Wizardry!"
"Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like
that!" cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. "It was an accident!
We don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!"
But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the
Ministry of Magic.
"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a
pudding in my uncle's house!" he told Fudge, frowning. "The Ministry of
Magic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic
there!"
Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking
awkward.
"Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the
present climate... Surely you don't want to be expelled?"
38
"Of course I don't," said Harry.
"Well then, what's A the fuss about?" laughed Fudge. "Now, have a
crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you."
Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was
something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at
the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he'd done? And now
Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for the Minister of
Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?
Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.
"Room eleven's free, Harry," said Fudge. "I think you'll be very
comfortable. just one thing, and I'm sure you'll understand... I don't
want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon
Alley. And you're to be back here before dark each night. Sure you'll
understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me."
"Okay," said Harry slowly, "but why?"
"Don't want to lose you again, do we?" said Fudge with a hearty laugh.
"No, no... best we know where you are.... I mean..."
Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.
"Well, I'll be off, plenty to do, you know...
"Have you had any luck with Black yet?" Harry asked.
Fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.
"What's that? Oh, you've heard -- well, no, not yet, but it's only a
matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed... and they are
angrier than I've ever seen them."
Fudge shuddered slightly.
"So, I'll say good-bye."
39
He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.
"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?"
"Certainly," said Fudge with a smile.
"Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my
aunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form. D'you think you could
--?"
Fudge was looking uncomfortable.
"Ah," he said. "No, no, I'm very sorry, Harry, but as I'm not your
parent or guardian --"
"But you I re the Minister of Magic," said Harry eagerly. "If you gave
me permission
"No, I'm sorry, Harry, but rules are rules," said Fudge flatly.
'Perhaps You'll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think
it's best if you don't... yes... well, I'll be off Enjoy your stay,
Harry."
And with a last smile and shake of Harry's hand, Fudge left the room.
Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.
"If you'll follow me, Mr. Potter," he said, "I've already taken your
things up..."
Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass
number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.
Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak
furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the
wardrobe -
"Hedwig!" Harry gasped.
40
The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry's arm.
"Very smart owl you've got there, chuckled Tom. "Arrived about five
minutes after you did. If there's anything you need, Mr. Potter, don't
hesitate to ask."
He gave another bow and left.
Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.
The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue
to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry
could hardly believe that he'd left Privet Drive only a few hours ago,
that he wasn't expelled, and that he was now facing two completely
Dursley-free weeks.
"It's been a very weird night, Hedwig," he yawned.
And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows
and fell asleep.
CHAPTER FOUR
THE LEAKY CAULDRON
It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never
before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he
fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in
Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most
fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break
his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for
a day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest
article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs;
and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of
raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand back
41
as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were
showing one another their purchases ( " it , s a lunascope, old boy --
no more messing around with moon charts, see?") or else discussing the
case of Sirius Black ("personalty, I won't let any of the children out
alone until he's back in Azkaban"). Harry didn't have to do his homework
under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright
sunshine outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his
essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart
from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free
sundaes every half an hour.
Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver
Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to
exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He
had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts,
and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to
stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a
wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a
nasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a
point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the
galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to
take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry's
resolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch
Supplies, a week after he'd arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.
Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged
his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards
until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most
magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.
"Just come out -- prototype --" a square-jawed wizard was telling his
companion.
"It's the fastest broom in the world, isn't it, Dad?" squeaked a boy
younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father's arm.
"Irish International Side's Just put in an order for seven of these
42
beauties!" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. "And they're
favorites for the World Cup!"
A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign
next to the broom:
** THE FIREBOLT **
THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED,
SUPERFINE
HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND
HAND- NUMBERED
WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY
SELECTED BIRCH TWIG
IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC
PERFECTION, GIVING THE
FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION.
THE FIREBOLT HAS
AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND
INCORPORATES AN
UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.
Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the
Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole
life -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nim bus Two
Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the
Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for
the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at
the Firebolt.
There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the
Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his
school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he
visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most
important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include
those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and
Divination.
Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of
the usual display of gold- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs,
43
there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred
copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying
everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in
furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.
Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the
first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book
for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said
it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether
Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.
As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward
him.
"Hogwarts?" he said abruptly. "Come to get your new books?"
"Yes," said Harry, "I need --"
"Get out of the way," said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry
aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large,
knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster
Books' cage.
"Hang on," said Harry quickly, "I've already got one of those."
"Have you?" A look of enormous relief spread over the manager's face.
"Thank heavens for that. I've been bitten five times already this
morning --"
A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a
third and were pulling it apart.
"Stop it! Stop it!" cried the manager, poking the walking stick through
the bars and knocking the books apart. "I'm never stocking them again,
never! It's been bedlam! I thought we'd seen the worst when we bought
two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -cost a
fortune, and we never found them.... Well... is there anything else I
can help you with?"
"Yes," said Harry, looking down his booklist, "I need Unfogging the
44
Future by Cassandra Vablatsky."
"Ah, starting Divination, are you?" said the manager, stripping off his
gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a
corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with
volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against
Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.
"Here you are,,' said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to
take down a thick, black- bound book. "Unfogging the Future. Very good
guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods - palmistry, crystal
balls, bird entrails.
But Harry wasn't listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which
was among a display on a small table: Death Omens.- What to Do When You
Know the Worst Is Coming.
"Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you," said the manager lightly,
looking to see what Harry was staring at. "You'll start seeing death
omens everywhere. It's enough to frighten anyone to death. "
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a
black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly
familiar...
The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry's hands.
"Anything else?" he said.
"Yes," said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog's and dazedly
consulting his booklist. "Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three."
Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new
books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly
noticing where he was going and bumping into several people.
He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books
onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and
sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the
45
unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd
below in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the
basin.
"It can't have been a death omen," he told his reflection defiantly. "I
was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent.... It was
probably just a stray dog...."
He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat
"You're fighting a losing battle there, dear," said his mirror in a
vvheezy voice.
As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a
sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in
Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus
Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch
Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the
real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish
and Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid
his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking
grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to be
Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.
Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at
least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got
up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just
wondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he
turned.
"Harry! HARRY!"
They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice
Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Her,,one very brown,
both waving frantically at him.
"Finally!" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. "We went to the
Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and
Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and --"
46
"I got all my school stuff last week," Harry explained. "And how come
You knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?" "Dad," said Ron simply.
Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have
heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.
"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?" said Hermione in a very
serious voice.
"I didn't mean to," said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. "I just
-- lost control."
"It's not funny, Ron," said Hermione sharply. "Honestly, I'm amazed
Harry wasn't expelled."
"So am I," admitted Harry. "Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be
arrested." He looked at Ron. "Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let me
off, does he?"
"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?" shrugged Ron, still chuckling.
"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd
do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first,
because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this
evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can
come to King's Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione's there as well!"
Hermione nodded, beaming. "Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with
all my Hogwarts things."
"Excellent!" said Harry happily. "So, have you got all your new books
and stuff?"
"Look at this," said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and
opening it. "Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one
unicorn tail-hair. And we've got all our books --" He pointed at a large
bag under his chair. "What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant
nearly cried when we said we wanted two."
"What's all that, Hermione?" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three
47
bulging bags in the chair next to her.
,,Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't IF' said Hermione.
"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures,
Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --"
"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?" said Ron, rolling his eyes at
Harry. "You're Muggle- born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already
know all about Muggles!"
"But it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of
view," said Hermione earnestly.
"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?" asked
Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.
"I've still got ten Galleons," she said, checking her purse. "It's my
birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself
an early birthday present."
"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.
"No, I don't think so," said Hermione composedly. "I really want an owl.
I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --"
"I haven't," said Ron. "Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers."
He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. "And I want to get him checked
over," he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. "I
don't think Egypt agreed with him."
Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop
to his whiskers.
"There's a magical creature shop just over there," said Harry, who knew
Diagon Alley very well by now. "You could see if they've got anything
for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl,"
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical
Menagerie.
48
There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages.
It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages were
all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the
counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts,
so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.
A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead
blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was
glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly
up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing
into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there
were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny
custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a
vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping
game using their long, bald tails.
The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.
"It's my rat," he told the witch. "He been a bit off-color ever since I
brought him back from Egypt."
"Bang him on the counter," said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black
spectacles out of her pocket.
Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the
cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled
to the wire for a better took.
Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he
had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to
the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.
"Hm," said the witch, picking up Scabbers. "How old is this rat?"
"Dunno," said Ron. "Quite old. He used to belong to my brother."
"What powers does he have?" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.
"Er --" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace
of interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers's tattered
49
left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.
"He's been through the mill, this one," she said.
"He was like that when Percy gave him to me," said Ron defensively.
"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live
longer than three years or so," said the witch. "Now, if you were
looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of
these --"
She indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron
muttered, "Show-offs."
"Well, if you Don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,"
said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red
bottle.
"Okay," said Ron. "How much -- OUCH!"
Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of
the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself,
spitting madly, at Scabbers.
"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between
her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then
scampered for the door.
"Scabbers!" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry
followed.
It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge
under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed
the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging
his head.
"What was that?"
"It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger," said Harry.
50
"Where's Hermione?"
"Probably getting her owl
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl.
Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
"You bought that monster?" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
"He's gorgeous, isn't he?" said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was
thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face
looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a
brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was
purring contentedly in Hermione's arms.
"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!" said Ron.
"He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?" said Hermione.
"And what about Scabbers?" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. "He needs rest and relaxation! How's he going to get it with
that thing around?"
"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic," said Hermione, slapping
the small red bottle into Ron's hand. "And stop worrying, Crookshanks
will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's the
problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages;
no one wanted him."
"Wonder why," said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky
Cauldron.
They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet.
"Harry!" he said, smiling as he looked up. "How are you?"
"Fine, thanks," said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley
51
with A their shopping.
Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture
of Sirius Black staring up at him.
"They still haven't caught him, then?" he asked.
"No," said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. "They've pulled us all
off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so
far."
"Would we get a reward if we caught him?" asked Ron. "It'd be good to
get some more money --"
"Don't be ridiculous, Ron," said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection
looked very strained. "Black's not going to be caught by a
thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back,
You mark my words."
At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags
and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start
their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the
Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.
Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more
heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had
saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red
and muttered "hello" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out
his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, "Harry.
How nice to see you.
"Hello, Percy," said Harry, trying not to laugh.
I hope you're well?" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather
like being introduced to the mayor.
"Very well, thanks --"
"Harry!" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply.
"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --"
52
"Marvelous," said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in
turn. "Absolutely spiffing."
Percy scowled.
"That's enough, now," said Mrs. Weasley.
"Mum!" said Fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing her
hand too. "How really corking to see you --"
"I said, that's enough," said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in
an empty chair. "Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our exciting
news?" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest.
"Second Head Boy in the family!" she said, swelling with pride.
"And last," Fred muttered under his breath.
I don't doubt that," said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. "I notice
they haven't made you two prefects."
"What do we want to be prefects for?" said George, looking revolted at
the very idea. "It'd take all the fun out of life."
Ginny giggled.
"Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!" snapped Mrs.
Weasley.
"Ginny's got other brothers to set her an example, Mother," said Percy
loftily. "I'm going up to change for dinner..."
He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.
"We tried to shut him in a pyramid," he told Harry. "But Mum spotted
us."
Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put
three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and
Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.
53
"How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?" asked Fred as they
dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.
"The Ministry's providing a couple of cars," said Mr. Weasley.
Everyone looked up at him.
"Why?" said Percy curiously.
"It's because of you, Perce," said George seriously. "And there'll be
little flags on the hoods, with HB on them"
"-- for Humongous Bighead," said Fred.
Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.
"Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?" Percy asked again, in a
dignified voice.
"Well, as we haven't got one anymore," said Mr. Weasley,
"-- and as I work there, they're doing me a favor --"
His voice was casual, but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr.
Weasley's ears had gone red, just like Ron's did when he was under
Pressure.
"Good thing, too," said Mrs. Weasley briskly. "Do you realize how much
luggage you've all got between you? A nice sight you'd be on the Muggle
Underground.... You are all packed, aren't you?"
"Ron hasn't put all his new things in his trunk yet," said Percy, in a
long-suffering voice. "He's dumped them on my bed."
"You'd better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won't have much time
in the morning," Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at
Percy.
After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made
54
their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next
day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and
locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and
went to see what was going on.
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.
"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing
"I haven't touched it, all right?" Ron roared back.
"What's up?" said Harry.
"My Head Boy badge is gone," said Percy, rounding on Harry.
"So's Scabbers's rat tonic," said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk
to look. "I think I might've left it in the bar --"
"You're not going anywhere till you've found my badge!" yelled Percy.
"I'll get Scabbers's stuff, I'm packed," Harry said to Ron, and he went
downstairs.
Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark,
when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A
second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.
Weasleys'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard them
arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer
to the parlor door.
"--makes no sense not to tell him," Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly.
"Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but he insists
on treating Harry like a child. He's thirteen years old and --"
"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. "Do
you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him?
For heaven's sake, he's happy not knowing!"
"I don't want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!"
55
retorted Mr. Weasley. "You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering
off by themselves -- they've ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! But
Harry mustn't do that this year! When I think what could have happened
to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn't picked
him up, I'm prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry
found him."
"But he's not dead, he's fine, so what's the point
"Molly, they say Sirius Black's mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever
enough to escape from Azkaban, and that's supposed to be impossible.
It's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and I
don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer
catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we
know for sure is what Black's after
"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts."
"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of
Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts."
"But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry
There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his
fist on the table.
"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in
the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to
Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been
talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: 'He's at
Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants
Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring
You-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry
stopped You- Know-Who, and he's had twelve years alone in Azkaban to
brood on that...."
There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to
hear more.
"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're
56
forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at
Hogwarts while Dumbledore's headmaster. I suppose he knows about all
this?"
"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards
stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He
wasn't happy about it, but he agreed."
"Not happy? Why shouldn't he be happy, if they're there to catch Black?"
"Dumbledore isn't fond of the Azkaban guards," said Mr. Weasley heavily.
"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you're dealing with a wizard
like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather
avoid."
"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them,
said Mr. Weasley wearily. "It's late, Molly, we'd better go up...."
Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the
passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few
seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing
the stairs.
The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at
earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom door
close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.
Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving
with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron's room
in search of his badge.
"We've got it," Fred whispered to Harry. "We've been improving it."
The badge now read Bighead Boy.
Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself
in his room and lay down on his bed.
So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been
lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He'd made
57
Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards
to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them
all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry
until he was on the train.
Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why
he didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people
with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be
panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree
wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was
wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say that
Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of?
Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightened
of him?
And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about.
They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed
all around the school, Black's chances of getting inside seemed very
remote.
No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his
chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want
Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact,
Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the
danger had passed.
He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn't look after
himself? He'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn't completely
useless....
Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent
crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...
"I'm not going to be murdered," Harry said out loud.
"That's the spirit, dear," said his mirror sleepily.
CHAPTER FIVE
THE DEMENTOR
58
Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup
of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig
to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling
a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.
"The sooner we get on the train, the better," he said. "At least I can
get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he's accusing me of dripping tea on
his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know," Ron grimaced, "his
girlfriend. She's hidden her face under the frame because her nose has
gone all blotchy..."
"I've got something to tell you," Harry began, but they were interrupted
by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating
Percy again.
They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front
page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was
telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young
girl. All three of them were rather giggly.
"What were you saying?" Ron asked Harry as they sat down.
"Later," Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.
Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving;
they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's
narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and
Hermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small
wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.
"It's all right, Crookshanks," Hermione cooed through the wickerwork.
"I'll let you out on the train."
"You won't," snapped Ron. "What about poor Scabbers, eh?"
He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was
curled up in his pocket.
Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck
59
his head inside.
"They're here, he said. "Harry, come on."
Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward
the first of two old- fashioned dark green cars, each of which was
driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.
"In you get, Harry," said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded
street.
Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione,
Ron, and, to Ron's disgust, Percy.
The journey to King's Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry's
trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost
ordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that
Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. They
reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers
found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute
to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of
an unmoving line at the traffic lights.
Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station.
"Right then," he said, glancing around them. "Let's do this in pairs, as
there are so many of us. I'll go through first with Harry."
Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten,
pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity
125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at
Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts
Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed
with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at a run.
60
"Ah, there's Penelope!" said Percy, smoothing his hair and going Pink
again. Ginny caught Harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide their
laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking
with his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge.
stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from
view.
"I need to talk to you in private," Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione
as the train picked up speed.
"Go away, Ginny," said Ron.
"Oh, that's nice," said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty
compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the
train.
This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the
window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts
Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an
adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.
The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that
had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though
quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.
"Who d'you reckon he is?" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door
shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.
"Professor R. J. Lupin," whispered Hermione at once.
"How d'you know that?"
"It's on his case," she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the
man's head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a
large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin
was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.
61
"Wonder what he teaches?" said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin's pallid
profile.
"That's obvious," whispered Hermione. "There's only one vacancy, isn't
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors
that the job was jinxed.
"well, I hope he's up to it," said Ron doubtfully. "He looks like on,
good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway..." He turned to
Harry. "What were you going to tell us?"
Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the
warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. \When he'd finished, Ron looked
thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally
lowered them to say, "Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh,
Harry... you'll have to be really, really careful. don't go looking for
trouble, Harry --"
"I Don't go looking for trouble," said Harry, nettled. "Trouble usually
finds me."
"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants
to kill him?" said Ron shakily.
They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and
Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.
"No one knows how he got out of Azkaban," said Ron uncomfortably. "No
one's ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too."
"But they'll catch him, won't they?" said Hermione earnestly. "I Mean,
they've got all the Muggles looking out for him too...." "What's that
noise?" said Ron suddenly.
A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked
all around the compartment.
62
"It's coming from your trunk, Harry," said Ron, standing UP and reaching
into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket
Sneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spinning very fast in
the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.
"Is that a Sneakoscope?" said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a
better look.
"Yeah... mind you, it's a very cheap one," Ron said. "It went haywire
just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry."
"Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?" said Hermione
shrewdly.
"No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he's not
really up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry's
present to him?"
"Stick it back in the trunk," Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled
piercingly, "or it'll wake him up."
He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a
particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, which deadened
the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.
"We could get it checked in Hogsmeade," said Ron, sitting back down.
"They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments
and stuff. Fred and George told me."
"Do you know much about Hogsmeade?" asked Hermione keenly. "I've read
it's the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --"
"Yeah, I think it is," said Ron in an offhand sort of way.
"But that's not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey
Dukes."
"What's that?" said Hermione.
63
"It's this sweetshop," said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face,
"where they've got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke at
the mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and
clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in
class and just look like you're thinking what to write next --"
"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?" Hermione pressed
on eagerly. "In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the
headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades
supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --"
"-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off
the ground while you're sucking them," said Ron, who was plainly not
listening to a word Hermione was saying.
Hermione looked around at Harry.
"Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?"
"'Spect it will," said Harry heavily. "You'll have to tell me when
You've found out."
"What d'you mean?" said Ron.
"I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge
wouldn't either."
Ron looked horrified.
""You're not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone
will give you permission -- " musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a
pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly
hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.
"Well, look who it is," said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling
open the compartment door. "Potty and the Weasel."
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.
"I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer,
64
Weasley," said Malfoy. "Did your mother die of shock?"
Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor.
Professor Lupin gave a snort.
"Who's that?" said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he
spotted Lupin.
"New teacher," said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed
to hold Ron back. "What were you saying, Malfoy?"
Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed; he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right
under a teacher's nose.
"C'mon," he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they
disappeared.
Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.
"I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year," he said angrily.
"I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I'm going to get
hold of his head and --"
Ron made a violent gesture in midair.
"Ron," hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, "be careful..."
But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.
The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were
now a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanterns
flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.
The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still,
Professor Lupin slept.
"We must be nearly there," said Ron, leaning forward to look past
Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.
The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.
65
"Great," said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin
to try and see outside. "I'm starving. I want to get to the feast....
"We can't be there yet," said Hermione, checking her watch.
"So why're we stopping?"
The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons
fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the
windows.
Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All
along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their
compartments.
The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told
them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning,
all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.
"'What's going on?" said Ron's voice from behind Harry.
"Ouch!" gasped Hermione. "Ron, that was my foot!"
Harry felt his way back to his seat.
"D'you think we've broken down?"
"Dunno..."
There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron,
wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.
"There's something moving out there," Ron said. "I think people are
coming aboard...."
The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over
Harry's legs.
"Sorry -- d'you know what's going on? -- Ouch -- sorry
66
"Hullo, Neville," said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling
Neville up by his cloak.
"Harry? Is that you? What's happening?"
"No idea -- sit down --"
There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on
Crookshanks.
"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on," came Hermione's
voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and
then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.
"Who's that?"
"Who's that?"
"Ginny?"
"Hermione?"
"What are you doing?"
"I was looking for Ron --" "Come in and sit down --"
"Not here!" said Harry hurriedly. "I'm here!"
"Ouch!" said Neville.
"Quiet!" said a hoarse voice suddenly.
Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear
movements in his corner.
None of them spoke.
There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the
compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.
They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and
67
wary.
"Stay where you are," he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got
slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.
But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.
Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's
hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was
completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and
what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from
the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed,
like something dead that had decayed in water...
But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature
beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn
into the folds of its black cloak.
And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow,
rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than
air from its surroundings.
An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in
his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest,
it was inside his very heart....
Harry's eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn't see. He was drowning
in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was
being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .
And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified,
pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his
arms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside
him -
"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?"
Someone was slapping his face.
"W -- what?"
68
Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was
shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come
back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and
Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville
and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his
hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.
Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.
"Are you okay?" Ron asked nervously.
"Yeah," said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature
had vanished. "What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who screamed?"
"No one screamed," said Ron, more nervously still.
Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked
back at him, both very pale.
"But I heard screaming --"
A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous
slab of chocolate into pieces.
"Here," he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. "Eat
it. It'll help."
Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it.
"What was that thing?" he asked Lupin.
"A dementor," said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else.
"One of the dementors of Azkaban."
Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate
wrapper and put it in his pocket.
"Eat," he repeated. "It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse
me...
69
He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.
"Are you sure you're okay, Harry?" said Hermione, watching Harry
anxiously.
"I Don't get it.... What happened?" said Harry, wiping more sweat off
his face.
"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I
mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you
"I thought you were having a fit or something," said Ron, who still
looked scared. "You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and
started twitching -- 11
"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor,
and pulled out his wand," said Hermione, "and he said, 'None of us is
hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move,
so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at
it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... "
"It was horrible," said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. "Did YOU
feel how cold it got when it came in?"
I felt weird," said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. "Like I'd
never be cheerful again...."
Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry
felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm
around her.
"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?" said Harry awkwardly.
"No," said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. "Ginny was shaking
like mad, though...."
Harry didn't understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were
recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame.
Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?
70
Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around,
and said, with a small smile, "I haven't poisoned that chocolate, you
know...."
Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly
to the tips of his fingers and toes.
"We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes," said Professor Lupin. "Are you
all right, Harry?"
Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.
"Fine," he muttered, embarrassed.
They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last,
the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble
to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked
loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain
was driving down in icy sheets.
"Firs' years this way!" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end
of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward
for their traditional journey across the lake.
"All right, you three?" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They
waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of
people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and
out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches
awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by
an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door,
the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.
The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the
chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him
sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.
As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron
71
gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,
Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either
side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned
back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the
gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the
castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many
turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt,
and Hermione and Ron got out.
As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.
"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy
fainted?"
Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to
the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously.
"Shove off, Malfoy," said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.
"Did you faint as well, Weasley?" said Malfoy loudly. "Did the scary old
dementor frighten you too, Weasley?"
"Is there a problem?" said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten
out of the next carriage.
Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches
on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm
in his voice, he said, "Oh, no -- er -- Professor," then he smirked at
Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.
Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of
them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front
doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming
torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper
floors.
The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the
crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which
was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, "Potter! Granger! I
want to see you both!"
72
Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall,
Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over
the heads of the crowd. She was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair
in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry
fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor
McGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something
wrong.
"There's no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in MY office,"
she told them. "Move along there, Weasley."
Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from
the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up
the marble staircase, and along a corridor.
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire,
Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She
settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, "Professor Lupin sent
an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter."
Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam
Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.
Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he'd
passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all this
fuss.
"I'm fine," he said, "I don't need anything
"Oh, it's you, is it?" said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending
down to stare closely at him. "I suppose you've been doing something
dangerous again?"
"It was a dementor, Poppy," said Professor McGonagall.
They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly.
"Setting dementors around a school, she muttered, pushing back Harry's
hair and feeling his forehead. "He won't be the last one who collapses.
73
Yes, he's all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they
have on people who are already delicate
"I'm not delicate!" said Harry crossly.
"Of course you're not," said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking
his pulse.
"What does he need?" said Professor McGonagall crisply. "Bed rest?
Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?"
"I'm fine!" said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy
would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.
"Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least," said Madam
Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry's eyes.
"I've already had some," said Harry. "Professor Lupin gave me some. He
gave it to all of us."
"Did he, now?" said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. "So we've finally got a
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?"
"Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?" Professor McGonagall said
sharply.
"Yes, "said Harry.
"Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss
Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast
together."
Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the
hospital wing, muttering to herself He had to wait only a few minutes;
then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by
Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the
marble staircase to the Great Hall.
It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was
lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of
74
candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor
Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was
carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.
"Oh," said Hermione softly, "we've missed the Sorting!"
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the
sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to
(Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall
strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and
Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward
the Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along
the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story
of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?
He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them
seats.
"What was all that about?" he muttered to Harry.
Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster
stood up to speak, and he broke off.
Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of
great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard,
half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was often
described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why Harry
respected him. You couldn't help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry
watched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the
first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.
"Welcome!" said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard.
"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you
all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out
of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast...."
Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, "As you will all be aware
after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently
playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on
Ministry of Magic business."
75
He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about
Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.
"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds," Dumbledore
continued, "and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody
is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by
tricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks," he added blandly,
and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. "It is not in the nature of a
dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and
every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the
prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student
runs afoul of the dementors," he said.
Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest
again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked
very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.
"On a happier note," he continued, I am pleased to welcome two new
teachers to our ranks this year.
"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who
had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped
hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next
to all the other teachers in their best robes.
"Look at Snape!" Ron hissed in Harry's ear.
Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table
at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape ,anted the
Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was
startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyond
anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was
the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.
"As to our second new appointment," Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm
applause for Professor Lupin died away. "Well, I am sorry to tell you
76
that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher,
retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his
remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be
filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this
teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they
joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor
table in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who was
ruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide
grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.
"We should've known!" Ron roared, pounding the table. "Who else would
have assigned us a biting book?"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as
Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was
wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.
"Well, I think that's everything of importance," said Dumbledore. "Let
the feast begin!"
The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and
drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could
reach and began to eat.
It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the
clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were
eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how
much being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn't a fully
qualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year
for a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione
who had cleared Hagrid's name last year.
At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the
golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all
to go to bed, and they got their chance.
"Congratulations, Hagrid!" Hermione squealed as they reached the
teachers' table.
77
"All down ter you three," said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his
napkin as he looked up at them., "Can' believe it... great man,
Dumbledore... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn
said he'd had enough.... It's what I always wanted. --"
Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor
McGonagall shooed them away.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble
staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, UP more and more
stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower's large portrait of a
fat lady in a pink dress asked them, "Password?"
"Coming through, coming through!" Percy called from behind the crowd.
"The new password's 'Fortuna Major'!"
"Oh no," said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble
remembering the passwords.
Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys
divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair
with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They
reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster
beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.
CHAPTER SIX
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the
next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be
entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As
they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and
there was a roar of laughter.
"Ignore him," said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. "Just ignore
him, it's not worth it...."
"Hey, Potter!" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face
78
like a pug. "Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!"
Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George
Weasley.
"New third-year course schedules," said George, passing then, over.
"What's up with you, Harry?"
"Malfoy," said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over
at the Slytherin table.
George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror
again.
"That little git," he said calmly. "He wasn't so cocky last night when
the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our
compartment, didn't he, Fred?"
"Nearly wet himself," said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.
"I wasn't too happy myself," said George. "They're horrible things,
those dementors...."
"Sort of freeze your insides, don't they?" said Fred.
"You didn't pass out, though, did you?" said Harry in a low voice.
"Forget it, Harry," said George bracingly. "Dad had to go out to Azkaban
one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he'd ever
been, he came back all weak and shaking.... They suck the happiness out
of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there."
"Anyway, we'll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch
match," said Fred. "Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the
season, remember?"
The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch
match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more
cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.
79
Hermione was examining her new schedule.
" Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today," she said happily.
villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come I. scorn
at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!"
They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out
of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down
in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing
made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.
"Are you all right?" said Harry, moving closer to the picture.
"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!"
The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up,
but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all
his might, he couldn't get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back
down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.
"Listen," said Harry, taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion,
"we're looking for the North Tower. You don't know the way, do you?"
"A quest!" The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to
his feet and shouted, "Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find
our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!"
He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the
fat pony, gave up, and cried, "On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady!
On! On!"
And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of
sight.
They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his
armor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture
ahead.
"Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!" yelled the knight, and
they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in
80
crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.
Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling
steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur
of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom.
"Farewell!" cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some
sinister-looking monks. "Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have
need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!"
"Yeah, we'll call you," muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, "if we
ever need someone mental."
They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where
most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off this
landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there
was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.
"'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,"' Harry read. "How're we
supposed to get up there?"
As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a
silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet. Everyone got quiet.
"After you," said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.
He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In
fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between
someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At leasttwenty small,
circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz
armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson
light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps
were draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the fire
that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy,
sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves
running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking
feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards,
countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.
Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all
81
talking in whispers.
"Where is she?" Ron said.
A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.
"Welcome," it said. "How nice to see you in the physical world at last."
Harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect.
Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was
very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their
natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable
chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands
were encrusted with bangles and rings.
"Sit, my children, sit," she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into
armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves
around the same round table.
"Welcome to Divination," said Professor Trelawney, who had seated
herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. "My name is professor
Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too
often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner
Eye."
Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor
Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, "So you have
chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I
must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is
very little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so far
in this field...."
At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who
looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this
subject.
"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud
bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate
the veiled mysteries of the future," Professor Trelawney went on, her
enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. "It is a Gift
82
granted to few. You, boy," she said suddenly to Neville, who almost
toppled off his pouf. "Is your grandmother well?"
"I think so," said Neville tremulously.
"I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear," said Professor Trelawney,
the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped.
Professor Trelawney continued placidly. "We will be covering the basic
methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to
reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the
way, my dear," she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, "beware a red-haired
man."
Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged
her chair away from him.
"In the second term," Professor Trelawney went on, "we shall progress to
the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is.
Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of
flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number
will leave us forever."
A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor
Trelawney seemed unaware of it.
"I wonder, dear," she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank
back in her chair, "if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?"
Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the
shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.
"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it
will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October."
Lavender trembled.
"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the
shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink
until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with
the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the
83
last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to
read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of
Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing.
Oh, and dear" -- she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up --
"after you've broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select
one of the blue patterned ones? I'm rather attached to the pink."
Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when
there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to
him holding a dustpan and brush and said, "One of the blue ones, then,
dear, if you wouldn't mind... thank you. ... "
When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their
table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the
dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the
cups and swapped over.
"Right," said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six.
"What can you see in mine?"
"A load of soggy brown stuff," said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in
the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid.
"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the
mundane!" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.
Harry tried to pull himself together.
"Right, you've got a crooked sort of cross... " He consulted Unfogging
the Future. "That means you're going to have 'trials and suffering' --
sorry about that -- but there's a thing that could be the sun... hang
on... that means 'great happiness'... so you're going to suffer but be
very happy...."
"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me," said Ron, and they both
had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their
direction.
"My turn..." Ron peered into Harry's teacup, his forehead wrinkled with
effort. "There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat," he said. "Maybe you're
84
going to work for the Ministry of Magic...
He turned the teacup the other way up.
"But this way it looks more like an acorn.... What's that?" He scanned
his copy of Unfogging the Future. "'A windfall, unexpected gold.'
Excellent, you can lend me some... and there's a thin, here," he turned
the cup again, "that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was its
head... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep..."
Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.
"Let me see that, my dear," she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over
and snatching Harry's cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.
Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it
counterclockwise.
"The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy."
"But everyone knows that, " said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor
Trelawney stared at her.
"Well, they do," said Hermione. "Everybody knows about Harry and
You-Know-Who."
Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration.
They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.
Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to
Harry's cup again and continued to turn it.
"The club... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup....
I thought that was a bowler hat," said Ron sheepishly.
"The skull... danger in your path, my dear...."
Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the
cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed.
85
There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his
second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her
glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed.
"My dear boy... my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say.. . no...
don't ask me...."
"What is it, Professor?" said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to
their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron's table,
pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a
good look at Harry's cup.
"My dear," Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically,
"You have the Grim."
"The what?" said Harry.
He could tell that he wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean
Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly
everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.
"The Grim, my dear, the Grim!" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked
shocked that Harry hadn't understood. "The giant, spectral dog that
haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- of
death!"
Harry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in
Flourish and Blotts -the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent...
Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was looking
at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around
to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair.
"I don't think it looks like a Grim," she said flatly.
Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike.
"You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little
aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the
86
future." Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.
"It looks like a Grim if you do this," he said, with his eyes almost
shut, "but it looks more like a donkey from here," he said, leaning to
the left.
"When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die Or not!"
said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want
to look at him.
"I think we will leave the lesson here for today," said Professor
Trelawney in her mistiest voice. "Yes... please pack away your
things...."
Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney,
packed away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding
Harry's eyes.
"Until we meet again," said Professor Trelawney faintly, "fair fortune
be yours. Oh, and dear" -- she pointed at Neville -- "you'll be late
next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the
winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall's
Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that,
early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.
Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he
were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept
shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at
any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them
about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and
wasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes
into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.
"Really, what has got into you all today?" said Professor McGonagall,
turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them
all. "Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation's
not got applause from a class."
87
Everybody's heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then
Hermione raised her hand.
"Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we
were reading the tea leaves, and --"
"Ah, of course," said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.
"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you
will be dying this year?"
Everyone stared at her.
"Me," said Harry, finally.
"I see," said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes.
"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the
death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of
them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a
new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my
colleagues --"
Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone
white. She went on, more calmly, "Divination is one of the most
imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have
very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor
Trelawney --"
She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, "You
look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't
let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not
hand it in."
Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared
of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling
perfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom. Not everyone was convinced,
however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, "But what
about Neville's cup?"
When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd
88
thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.
"Ron, cheer up," said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. "You
heard what Professor McGonagall said."
Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn't start.
"Harry," he said, in a low, serious voice, "You haven't seen a great
black dog anywhere, have you?"
"Yeah, I have," said Harry. "I saw one the night I left the Dursleys'. "
Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.
"Probably a stray," said Hermione calmly.
Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.
"Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad," he said. "My
-- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and he died twenty-four hours later!"
"Coincidence," said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.
"You don't know what you're talking about!" said Ron, starting to get
angry. "Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!"
"There you are, then," said Hermione in a superior tone. "They see the
Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death!
And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and
think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!"
Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new
Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.
"I think Divination seems very woolly," she said, searching for her
page. "A lot of guesswork, if you ask me."
"There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!" said Ron hotly.
"You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a
89
sheep," said Hermione coolly.
"Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't
like being bad at something for a change!"
He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the
table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.
"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens
in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer!
That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!"
She snatched up her bag and stalked away.
Ron frowned after her.
"What's she talking about?" he said to Harry. "She hasn't been to an
Arithmancy class yet."
Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday's rain
had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy
and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical
Creatures class.
Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other. Harry walked beside
them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut on
the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three
only-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be
having these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly
to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew
what they were talking about.
Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his
moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking
impatient to start.
"C'mon, now, get a move on!" he called as the class approached. "Got a
real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right,
follow me!"
90
For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them
into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to
last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the
trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of
paddock. There was nothing in there.
"Everyone gather 'round the fence here!" he called. "That's it -- make
sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer
books --"
"How?" said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.
"Eh?" said Hagrid.
"How do we open our books?" Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of The
Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope.
Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their
book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them
together with binder clips.
"Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books?" said Hagrid,
looking crestfallen.
The class all shook their heads.
"Yeh've got ter stroke 'em," said Hagrid, as though this was the most
obvious thing in the world. "Look --"
He took Hermione's copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The
book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine,
and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.
"Oh, how silly we've all been!" Malfoy sneered. "We should have stroked
them! why didn't we guess!"
"I -- I thought they were funny," Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione.
"Oh, tremendously funny!" said Malfoy. "Really witty, giving us books
that try and rip our hands off!"
91
"Shut up, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and
Harry wanted Hagrid's first lesson to be a success.
"Righ' then," said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, "so -- so
yeh've got yer books an' -- an' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures.
Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on... "
He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight.
"God, this place is going to the dogs," said Malfoy loudly. "That oaf
teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell him
"Shut up, Malfoy," Harry repeated.
"Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you
"Oooooooh!" squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side
of the paddock.
Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry
had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but
the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with
cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. The
talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.
Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was
attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the
vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the
creatures.
"Gee up, there!" he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures
toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as
Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.
"Hippogriffs!" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. "Beau'iful,
aren' they?"
Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first
shock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you started
to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from
feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze,
92
pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.
"So," said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, "if
yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer --"
No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached
the fence cautiously.
"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,"
said Hagrid. "Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one,
'cause it might be the last thing yeh do."
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an
undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to
disrupt the lesson.
"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move," Hagrid
continued. "It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh
wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow,
then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt.
"Right -- who wants ter go first?"
Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads
and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being
tethered like this.
"No one?" said Hagrid, with a pleading look.
"I'll do it," said Harry.
There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and
Parvati whispered, "Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!"
Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.
"Good man, Harry!" roared Hagrid. "Right then -- let's see how yeh get
on with Buckbeak."
93
He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its
fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side
of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were
narrowed maliciously.
"Easy) now, Harry," said Hagrid quietly. "Yeh've got eye contact, now
try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too
much...."
Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern.
Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with
one fierce orange eye. "Tha's it," said Hagrid. "Tha's it, Harry... now,
bow."
Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak,
but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.
The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move.
"Ah," said Hagrid, sounding worried. "Right -- back away, now, Harry,
easy does it
But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its
scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.
"Well done, Harry!" said Hagrid, ecstatic. "Right -- yeh can touch him!
Pat his beak, go on!"
Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved
slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the
beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though
enjoying it.
The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,
who were looking deeply disappointed.
"Righ' then, Harry," said Hagrid. "I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!"
This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick;
but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.
94
"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint," said Hagrid, "an' mind
yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that...."
Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto
its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on;
everything in front of him was covered with feathers.
"Go on, then'" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry,
he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was
soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which
one he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either
side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was
about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers
and he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of
his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and
forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its
wings.
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the
ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the
smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak,
then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He
just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.
"Good work, Harry!" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and
Goyle cheered. "Okay, who else wants a go?"
Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously
into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon
people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran
repeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend its
knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to
Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.
"This is very easy," Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him.
95
"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not
dangerous at all, are you?" he said to the hippogriff. "Are you, you
great ugly brute?"
It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched
scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his
collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,
blood blossoming over his robes.
"I'm dying!" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. "I'm dying, look at
me! It's killed me!"
"Yer not dyin'!" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. "Someone help me
-- gotta get him outta here --"
Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As
they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm;
blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward
the castle.
Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The
Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.
"They should fire him straight away!" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in
tears.
"It was Malfoy's fault!" snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed
their muscles threateningly.
They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.
"I'm going to see if he's okay!" said Pansy, and they all watched her
run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about
Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room;
Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.
"You think he'll be all right?" said Hermione nervously.
"Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second," said
Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.
96
"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though,
wasn't it?" said Ron, looking worried. "Trust Malfoy to mess things up
for him...."
They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping
to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there.
"They wouldn't fire him, would they?" said Hermione anxiously, not
touching her steak-and- kidney pudding.
"They'd better not," said Ron, who wasn't eating either.
Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe
and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure
they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.
"Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back," said Ron
gloomily.
They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and
tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all
three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.
"There's a light on in Hagrid's window," Harry said suddenly.
Ron looked at his watch.
"If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It's still quite early..."
I don't know," Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him.
"I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, " he said Pointedly. "Sirius
Black hasn't got past the dementors yet, has he?"
So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad
to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren't entirely
sure they were supposed to be out.
The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When
97
they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, "C'min."
Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his
boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid's lap. One look told them that
Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big
as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty
getting them into focus.
"'Spect it's a record," he said thickly, when he recognized them. "Don'
reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before."
"You haven't been fired, Hagrid!" gasped Hermione.
"Not yet," said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in
the tankard. "But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy..."
"How is he?" said Ron as they all sat down. "It wasn't serious, was it?"
"Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could," said Hagrid dully, "but he's
sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..
"He's faking it, " said Harry at once. "Madam Pomfrey can mend anything.
She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's
worth."
"School gov'nors have bin told, o' course," said Hagrid miseribly. "They
reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done
flobberworms or summat.... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons all
my fault...."
"It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!" said Hermione earnestly.
"We're witnesses," said Harry. "You said hippogriffs attack if you
insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening. We'll tell
Dumbledore what really happened."
"Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up," said Ron.
Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes.
He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.
98
"I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid," said Hermione firmly. She
took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.
"At, maybe she's right," said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who
both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of
his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud
splash.
"What's he done?" said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the
empty tankard.
"Stuck his head in the water barrel," said Hermione, putting the tankard
away.
Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water
out of his eyes.
"That's better," he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them
all. "Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --
Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he'd only just realized
he was there.
"WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU'RE DOIN', EH?" he roared, so suddenly that they
jumped a foot in the air. "YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND AFTER
DARK,
HARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN' HIM!"
Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the
door.
"C'mon!" Hagrid said angrily. "I'm takin' yer all back up ter school,
an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'm
not worth that!"
CHAPTER SEVEN
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE
99
Malfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when
the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He
swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound
up in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he were the heroic
survivor of some dreadful battle.
"How is it, Draco?" simpered Pansy Parkinson. "Does it hurt much?"
"Yeah," said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw
him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.
"Settle down, settle down," said Professor Snape idly.
Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn't have said "settle
down" if they'd walked in late, he'd have given them detention. But
Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape's
classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored his
own students above all others.
They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up
his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing
their ingredients on the same table.
"Sir," Malfoy called, "sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots,
because of my arm --"
"Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him," said Snape without looking up.
Ron went brick red.
"There's nothing wrong with your arm," he hissed at Malfoy.
Malfoy smirked across the table.
"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots."
Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy's roots toward him, and began to
chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.
"Professor," drawled Malfoy, "Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit."
100
Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots,
then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black
hair.
"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley."
"But, sit --!"
Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own
roots into exactly equal pieces.
"Now," said Snape in his most dangerous voice.
Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy,
then took up the knife again.
"And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned," said Malfoy, his voice
full of malicious laughter.
"Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig," said Snape, giving Harry the
look of loathing he always reserved just for him.
Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage
to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as
he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking.
Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.
"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?" he asked them quietly.
"None of your business," said Ron jerkily, without looking up.
"I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer," said Malfoy in a tone of
mock sorrow. "Father's not very happy about my injury --"
"Keep talking, Malfoy, and I'll give you a real injury," snarled Ron.
"- he's complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of
Magic. Father's got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury
like this" -- he gave a huge, fake sigh -- "who knows if my arm'll ever
101
be the same again?"
"So that's why you're putting it on," said Harry, accidentally beheading
a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger. "To try to get
Hagrid fired."
"Well," said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, "partly, Potter.
But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for
me."
A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to
pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear
of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His potion, which was
supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --
"Orange, Longbottom," said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash
back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.
"Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of
yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one -tat spleen
was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would
suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?"
Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge
of tears.
"Please, sir," said Hermione, "please, I could help Neville put it right
--"
"I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger," said Snape
coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. "Longbottom, at the end of
this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see
what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly."
Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.
"Help me!" he moaned to Hermione.
"Hey, Harry," said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass
scales, "have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon
102
Sirius Black's been sighted."
"Where?" said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table,
Malfoy looked up, listening closely.
"Not too far from here," said Seamus, who looked excited. "It was a
Muggle who saw him. 'Course, she didn't really understand. The Muggles
think he's just an ordinary criminal, don't they? So she phoned the
telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was
gone."
"Not too far from here... " Ron repeated, looking significantly at
Harry. He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. "What, Malfoy?
Need something else skinned?"
But Malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry.
He leaned across the table.
Black single-handed, Potter?"
"Thinking Of trying to catch
"Yeah, that's right," said Harry offhandedly.
Malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.
"Of course, if it was me," he said quietly, "I'd have done something
before now. I wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy, I'd be out
there looking for him."
"What are you talking about, Malfoy?" said Ron roughly.
"Don't you know, Potter?" breathed Malfoy, his pate eyes narrowed.
"Know what?"
Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.
"Maybe you'd rather not risk your neck," he said. "Want to leave it to
the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him
103
down myself."
"What are you talking about?" said Harry angrily, but at that moment
Snape called, "You should have finished adding your ingredients by now;
this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it
simmers and then we'll test Longbottom's... "
Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred
his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of
the corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn't see. Harry and Ron
packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and
ladles in the stone basin in the corner.
"What did Malfoy mean?" Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands
under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle's mouth "Why would I
want revenge on Black? He hasn't done anything to me -- yet.
"He's making it up," said Ron savagely. "He's trying to make you do
something stupid...."
The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was
cowering by his cauldron.
"Everyone gather 'round," said Snape, his black eyes glittering, and
watch what happens to Longbottom's toad. If he has managed to produce a
Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don't doubt,
he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned."
The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape
picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into
Neville's potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops down
Trevor's throat.
There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there
was a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape's palm.
The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small
bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor,
and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.
104
"Five points from Gryffindor," said Snape, which wiped the smiles from
every face. "I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry
was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething
about Snape.
"Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right!
Why didn't You lie, Hermione? You should've said Neville did it all by
himself!"
Hermione didn't answer. Ron looked around.
"Where is she?"
Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the
rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.
"She was right behind us," said Ron, frowning.
Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at
Harry and disappeared.
"There she is," said Harry.
Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched
her bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her
robes.
"How did you do that?" said Ron.
"What?" said Hermione, joining them.
"One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at
the bottom of the stairs again."
"What?" Hermione looked slightly confused. "Oh -- I had to go back for
something. Oh no --"
105
A seam had split on Hermione's bag. Harry wasn't surprised; he could see
that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.
"Why are you carrying all these around with you?" Ron asked her.
"You know how many subjects I'm taking," said Hermione breathlessly.
"Couldn't hold these for me, could you?"
"But --" Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at
the covers. "You havent got any of these subjects today. It's only
Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon."
"Oh yes," said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into
her bag just the same. I hope there's something good for lunch, I'm
starving," she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.
"D'you get the feeling Hermione's not telling us something?Ron asked
Harry.
Professor Lupin wasn't there when they arrived at his first Defense
Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books,
quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the
room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the
teacher's desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he
had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals.
"Good afternoon," he said. "Would you please put all your books back in
your bags. Today's will be a practical lesson. You will need only your
wands."
A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books.
They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before,
unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher
had brought a cageful of pixies -to class and set them loose.
"Right then," said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. "If you'd
follow me."
Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor
Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and
106
around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the
Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the
nearest keyhole with chewing gum.
Peeves didn't look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; ,hen he
wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.
"Loony, loopy Lupin," Peeves sang. "Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy
Lupin --"
Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed
some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor
Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still
smiling.
"I'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves," he said
pleasantly. "Mr. Filch won't be able to get in to his brooms."
Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who
waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However,
Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin's words, except to blow a
loud wet raspberry.
Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.
"This is a useful little spell, he told the class over his shoulder.
"Please watch closely."
He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, "Waddiwasi! "and pointed it
at Peeves.
With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the
keyhole and straight down Peeves's left nostril; he whirled upright and
zoomed away, cursing.
"Cool, sit!" said Dean Thomas in amazement.
"Thank you, Dean," said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again.
"Shall we proceed?"
107
They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with
increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right
outside the staffroom door.
"Inside, please," said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.
The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was
empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low
armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were
glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As
Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape
said, "Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this."
He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing
behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, "Possibly no
one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I
would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless
Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear."
Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he
bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other
teachers.
Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.
"I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the
operation," he said, "and I am sure he will perform it admirably."
Neville's face went, if possible, even redder. Snape's lip curled, but
he left, shutting the door with a snap.
"Now, then," said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of
the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers
kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the
wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
"Nothing to worry about," said Professor Lupin calmly because a few
people had jumped backward in alarm. "There's a boggart in there."
Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about.
108
Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan
eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces," said Professor Lupin. "Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met one
that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in
yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave
it to give my third years some practice.
"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?"
Hermione put up her hand.
"It's a shape-shifter," she said. "It can take the shape of whatever it
thinks will frighten us most."
"Couldn't have put it better myself," said Professor Lupin, and Hermione
glowed. "So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet
assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on
the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when
he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever
each of us most fears.
"This means," said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's 'mall
sputter of terror, "that we have a huge advantage over the boggart
before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?"
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and
down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very
off-putting, but Harry had a go.
"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it
should be?"
"Precisely," said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,
looking a little disappointed. "It's always best to have com pany when
you're dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he
become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart
make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and
turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.
109
"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of
mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter.
What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.
"We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ...
Riddikulus!"
"Riddikulus!" said the class together.
"Good," said Professor Lupin. "Very good. But that was the easy part,
I'm afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you
come in, Neville."
The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked
forward as though he were heading for the gallows.
"Right, Neville," said Professor Lupin. "First things first: what would
you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?"
Neville's lips moved, but no noise came out.
"didn't catch that, Neville, sorry," said Professor Lupin cheerfully.
Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help
him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, "Professor Snape."
Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor
Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.
"Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your
grandmother?"
"Er -- yes," said Neville nervously. "But -- I don't want the boggart to
turn into her either."
"No, no, you misunderstand me," said Professor Lupin, now smiling. "I
wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually
wears?"
110
Neville looked startled, but said, "Well... always the same hat. A tall
one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress... green,
normally... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf."
"And a handbag?" prompted Professor Lupin.
"A big red one," said Neville.
"Right then," said Professor Lupin. "Can you picture those clothes very
clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind's eye?"
"Yes," said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.
"When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it
will assume the form of Professor Snape," said Lupin. "And You will
raise your wand -- thus -- and cry 'Riddikulus' -- and concentrate hard
on your grandmother's clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape
will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with
that big red handbag."
There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more
violently.
"If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention
to each of us in turn," said Professor Lupin. "I would like all of you
to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and
imagine how you might force it to look comical...."
The room went quiet. Harry thought... 'What scared him most in the
world?
His first thought was Lord Voldemort -- a Voldemort returned to full
strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible
counterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to
the surface of his mind....
A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a
long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth... then a cold so penetrating
it felt like drowning....
111
Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many
people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, "Take
its legs off " Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron's
greatest fear was spiders.
"Everyone ready?" said Professor Lupin.
Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn't ready. How could you make a
dementor less frightening? But he didn't want to ask for more time;
everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.
"Neville, we're going to back away," said Professor Lupin. "Let you have
a clear field, all right? I'll call the next person forward.... Everyone
back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --"
They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone
beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up
the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready.
"On the count of three, Neville," said Professor Lupin, who was
pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. "One two -- three
-- now!"
A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the
doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor
Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.
Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing
down upon him, reaching inside his robes.
"R -- r -- riddikulus! "squeaked Neville.
There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a
long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten
vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.
There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and
Professor Lupin shouted, "Parvati! Forward!"
112
Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was
another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged
mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk
toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --
"Riddikulus!" cried Parvati.
A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face
forward, and its head rolled off.
"Seamus!" roared Professor Lupin.
Seamus darted past Parvati.
Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair
and a skeletal, green-tinged face -- a banshee. She opened her mouth
wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that
made the hair on Harry's head stand on end -- 'Riddikulus!" shouted
Seamus.
The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was
gone.
Crack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle,
then -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before
-- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.
'It's confused!" shouted Lupin. "We're getting there! Dean!"
Dean hurried forward.
Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began
to creep along the floor like a crab.
"Riddikulus!" yelled Dean.
'There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.
"Excellent! Ron, you next!"
113
Ron leapt forward.
Crack!
Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered
in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a
moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --
"Riddikulus!" bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished; it rolled
over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it
came to a halt at Harry's feet. He raised his wand, ready, but --
"Here!" shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!
The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly
around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in
the air in front of Lupin, who said, "Riddikulus!" almosi lazily.
Crack!
"Forward, Neville, and finish him off!" said Lupin as the boggart landed
on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville
charged forward looking determined.
"Riddikulus!" he shouted, and they had a split second's view of Snape in
his lacy dress before Neville let out a great "Ha!" of laughter, and the
boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was
gone.
"Excellent!" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause.
"Excellent) Neville. Well done, everyone.... Let me See... five points
to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Neville
because he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry."
"But I didn't do anything," said Harry.
"You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the
class, Harry," Lupin said lightly. "Very well, everyone, an excellent
lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it
for me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all."
114
Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn't
feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from
tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he'd seen Harry collapse on
the train, and thought he wasn't up to much? Had he thought Harry would
pass out again?
But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.
"Did you see me take that banshee?" shouted Seamus. "And the hand!" said
Dean, waving his own around.
"And Snape in that hat!" "And my mummy!"
I wonder why Professor Lupin's frightened of crystal balls?" said
Lavender thoughtfully.
"That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we've ever had,
wasn't it?" said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the
classroom to get their bags.
"He seems like a very good teacher," said Hermione approvingly. "But I
wish I could have had a turn with the boggart --"
"What would it have been for you?" said Ron, sniggering. "A piece of
homework that only got nine out of ten?"
CHAPTER EIGHT
FLIGHT OF THE FAT FADY
In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most
people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins
had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.
"Look at the state of his robes," Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as
Professor Lupin passed. "He dresses like our old houseelf "
But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and
frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first.
115
After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin like
creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons
of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to
bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to
kappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with
webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.
Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst
of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these
days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assuming
Snape's shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his
grandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.
Snape didn't seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the
very mention of Professor Lupin's name, and he was bullying Neville
worse than ever.
Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor
Trelawney's stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and
symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney's enormous eyes
filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn't like
Professer Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering
on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had
taken to haunting Professor Trelawney's tower room at lunch times, and
always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though
they knew things the others didn't. They had also started using hushed
voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.
Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the
action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to
have lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson
learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the
most boring creatures in existence.
"Why would anyone bother looking after them?" said Ron, after yet
another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms' throats.
At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy
him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory
classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and O1iver Wood, Captain
of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss
116
tactics for the new season.
There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it
was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball)
through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each
end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to
repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to
attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal
posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching
the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture
ended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred and
fifty points.
Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final
year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice a's
he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on
the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.
"This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,"
he told them, striding up and down in front of them. "I'll be leaving at
the end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it."
"Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now. Okay, so we've had the worst
luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called off
last year Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to
his throat. "But we also know we've got the
best-ruddy-team-in-the-school," he said, punching a fist into his other
hand, the old manic glint back in his eye. "We've got three superb
Chasers."
Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell.
"We've got two unbeatable Beaters."
"Stop it, Oliver, you're embarrassing us," said Fred and George Weasley
together, pretending to blush.
"And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!" Wood
117
rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. "And me," he
added as an afterthought.
"We think you're very good too, Oliver," said George.
"Spanking good Keeper," said Fred.
"The point is," Wood went on, resuming his pacing, "the Quidditch Cup
should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry
joined the team, I've thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven't
got it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see our
name on the thing...."
Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic.
"Oliver, this year's our year," said Fred.
"We'll do it, Oliver!" said Angelina.
"Definitely," said Harry.
Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three
evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights
darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry's
wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.
Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training,
cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the
room buzzing excitedly.
"What's happened?", he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two
of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for
Astronomy.
"First Hogsmeade weekend," said Ron, pointing at a notice that had
appeared on the battered old bulletin board. "End of October.
Halloween."
"Excellent," said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait
hole. "I need to visit Zonko's. I'm nearly out of Stink Pellets."
118
Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing
away. Hermione seemed to read his mind.
"Harry, I'm sure you'll be able to go next time," she said. "They're
bound to catch Black soon. He's been sighted once already."
"Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade," said Ron. "Ask
McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for
ages --"
"Ron!" said Hermione. "Harry's supposed to stay in school-"
"He can't be the only third year left behind," said Ron. "Ask
McGonagall, go on, Harry --"
"Yeah, I think I will," said Harry, making up his mind.
Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt
lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.
"Does he have to eat that in front of us?" said Ron, scowling.
"Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?" said Hermione.
Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed
insolently on Ron.
"Just keep him over there, that's all," said Ron irritably, turning back
to his star chart. "1've got Scabbers asleep in my bag."
Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own
star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out
parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.
"You can copy mine, if you like," said Ron, labeling his last star with
a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.
Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't say
anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking
119
the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.
"OY!" Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws
deep inside it and began tearing ferociously. "GET OFF, YOU STUPID
ANIMAL!"
Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung
on, spitting and slashing.
"Ron, don't hurt him!" squealed Hermione; the whole common room was
watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it,
and Scabbers came flying out of the top -
"CATCH THAT CAR' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the
remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the
terrified Scabbers.
George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers
streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of
drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs,
and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.
Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the
middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with
great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.
"Look at him!" he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front
of her. "He's skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!"
"Crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!" said Hermione, her voice
shaking. "All cats chase rats, Ron!"
"There's something funny about that animal!" said Ron, who was trying to
persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. "It heard
me say that Scabbers was in my bag!"
"Oh, what rubbish," said Hermione impatiently. "Crookshanks could smell
him, Ron, how else d'you think --"
"That cat's got it in for Scabbers!" said Ron, 'ignoring the people
120
around him, who were starting to giggle. "And Scabbers was here first,
and he's ill!"
Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to
the boys' dormitories.
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to
her all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were
working together on the same puffapod.
"How's Scabbers?" Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods
from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.
"He's hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking, " said Ron angrily,
missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor.
"Careful, Weasley, careful!" cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst
into bloom before their very eyes.
They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor
McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the
rest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was
going to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at
the front of the line.
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and
was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were
looking very serious.
"What's the matter, Lavender?" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry,
and Ron went to join the group.
"She got a letter from home this morning," Parvati whispered. "It's her
rabbit, Binky. He's been killed by a fox."
"Oh," said Hermione, "I'm sorry, Lavender."
"I should have known!" said Lavender tragically. "You know what day it
is?"
121
"Er --"
"The sixteenth of October! 'That thing you're dreading, it will happen
on the sixteenth of October!' Remember? She was right, she was right!"
The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head
seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, "You -- you were dreading
Binky being killed by a fox?"
"Well, not necessarily by a fox," said Lavender, looking up at Hermione
with streaming eyes, "but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't l?"
"Oh," said Hermione. She paused again. Then
"Was Binky an old rabbit?"
"N -- no!" sobbed Lavender. "H -- he was only a baby!"
Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender's shoulders.
"But then, why would you dread him dying?" said Hermione.
Parvati glared at her.
"Well, look at it logically," said Hermione, turning to the rest of the
group- "I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he? Lavender just got
the news today-" Lavender wailed loudly. "- and she can't have been
dreading it, because it's come as a real shock --"
"Don't mind Hermione, Lavender," said Ron loudly, "she doesn't think
other people's pets matter very much."
Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was
perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and
when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry
and didn't talk to each other for the whole class.
Harry still hadn't decided what he was going to say to Professor
McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she
who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.
122
"One moment, please !" she called as the class made to leave. "As you're
all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before
Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don't forget!"
Neville put up his hand.
"Please, Professor, I -- I think I've lost
"Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom," said Professor
McGonagall. "She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that's all, you may
leave."
"Ask her now," Ron hissed at Harry.
"Oh. but --" Hermione began.
"Go for it, Harry," said Ron stubbornly.
Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed
nervously for Professor McGonagall's desk.
"Yes, Potter?" Harry took a deep breath.
"Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form," he said.
Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn't
say anything.
"So -- er d'you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I
-- if I go to Hogsmeade?"
Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk.
"I'm afraid not, Potter," she said. "You heard what I said. No form, no
visiting the village. That's the rule."
"But -- Professor, my aunt and uncle -- you know, they're Muggles, they
don't really understand about -- about Hogwarts forms and stuff," Harry
said, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. "If you said I could go
123
--"
"But I don't say so," said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling
her papers neatly into a drawer. "The form clearly states that the
parent or guardian must give permission." She turned to look at him,
with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? "I'm sorry, Potter, but
that's my final word. You had better hurry, or you'll be late for your
next lesson."
There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of
names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an
"all-for-the-best" expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had
to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what
they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.
"There's always the feast," said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry UP.
"You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening."
"Yeah," said Harry gloomily, "great."
The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if
he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing
anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind. Dean
Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon's
signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor
McGonagall he hadn't had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly
suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one,
reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being
able to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful
words of comfort.
"They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it's not all
it's cracked up to be," he said seriously. "All right, the sweetshop's
rather good, and Zonko's Joke Shop's frankly dangerous, and yes, the
Shrieking Shack's always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from
that, you're not missing anything."
On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to
breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act
normally.
124
"We'll bring you. lots of sweets back from Honeydukes," said Hermione,
looking desperately sorry for him.
"Yeah, loads," said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their
squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties.
"Don't worry about me," said Harry, in what he hoped was at, offhand
voice, "I'll see you at the feast. Have a good time."
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker,
was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long
list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one
was sneaking out who shouldn't be going.
"Staying here, Potter?" shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. "Scared of passing the dementors?"
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
"Password?" said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.
"Fortuna Major," said Harry listlessly.
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common
room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older
students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had
worn off
"Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!"
It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and
never missed an opportunity to speak to him.
"Aren't you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey" -- Colin looked
eagerly around at his friends -- "you can come and sit with us, if you
like, Harry!"
"Er -- no, thanks, Colin," said Harry, who wasn't in the mood to have a
125
lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. "I -- I've got
to go to the library, got to get some work done."
After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out
of the portrait hole again.
"What was the point waking me up?" the Fat Lady called grumpily after
him as he walked away.
Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he
changed his mind; he didn't feel like working. He turned around and came
face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the
Hogsmeade visitors.
"What are you doing?" Filch snarled suspiciously.
"Nothing," said Harry truthfully.
"Nothing!" spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. "A likely
story! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren't you in Hogsmeade buying
Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your
nasty little friends?"
Harry shrugged.
"Well, get back to your common room where you belong!" snapped Filch,
and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.
But Harry didn't go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase,
thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking
along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said,
"Harry?"
Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin,
looking around his office door.
"What are you doing?" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from
Filch. "Where are Ron and Hermione?"
"Hogsmeade," said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.
126
"Ah," said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. "Why don't you come
in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson." "A
what?" said Harry. I
He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank
of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face
pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly
fingers.
"Water demon," said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. "We
shouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick
is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,
but very brittle."
The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle
of weeds in a corner.
"Cup of tea?" Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. "I was just
thinking of making one."
"All right," said Harry awkwardly.
Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued
suddenly from the spout.
"Sit down," said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. "I've only got
teabags, I'm afraid -- but I daresay you've had enough of tea leaves?"
Harry looked at him. Lupin's eyes were twinkling.
"How did you know about that?" Harry asked.
"Professor McGonagall told me," said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug
of tea. "You're not worried, are you?"
"No," said Harry.
He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he'd seen in
Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn't want Lupin to think he
127
was a coward, especially since Lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldn't
cope with a boggart.
Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because
Lupin said, "Anything worrying you, Harry?"
"No," Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow
brandishing a fist at him. "Yes," he said suddenly, putting his tea down
on Lupin's desk. "You know that day we fought the boggart?"
"Yes," said Lupin slowly.
"Why didn't you let me fight it?" said Harry abruptly.
Lupin raised his eyebrows.
"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry," he said, sounding
surprised.
Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he'd done any such thing, was
taken aback.
"Why?" he said again.
"Well," said Lupin, frowning slightly, "I assumed that if the boggart
faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort."
Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but Lupin
had said Voldemort's name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the
name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.
"Clearly, I was wrong," said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. "But I
didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the
staffroom. I imagined that people would panic."
"I didn't think of Voldemort," said Harry honestly. "I -- I remembered
those dementors."
"I see," said Lupin thoughtfully. "Well, well... I'm impressed." fie
smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face. "That suggests
128
that what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry."
Harry didn't know what to say to that, so he drank some mot,, tea.
"So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting
the boggart?" said Lupin shrewdly.
"Well... yeah," said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier.
"Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --"
He was interrupted by a knock on the door.
"Come in," called Lupin.
The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was
smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes
narrowing.
"Ah, Severus," said Lupin, smiling. "Thanks very much. Could you leave
it here on the desk for me?"
Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and
Lupin.
"I was just showing Harry my grindylow," said Lupin pleasantly, pointing
at the tank.
"Fascinating," said Snape, without looking at it. "You should drink that
directly, Lupin."
"Yes, Yes, I will," said Lupin.
"I made an entire cauldronful," Snape continued. "If you need more.
"I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus."
"Not at all," said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't
like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.
Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.
129
"Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me," he said. "I
have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly
complex." He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. "Pity sugar makes it
useless," he added, taking a sip and shuddering.
"Why --?" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished
question.
"I've been feeling a bit off-color," he said. "This potion is the only
thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor
Snape; there aren't many wizards who are up to making it."
Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the
goblet out of his hands.
"Professor Snape's very interested in the Dark Arts, he blurted out.
"Really?" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another
gulp of potion.
"Some people reckon --" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on,
"some people reckon he'd do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark
Arts job."
Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.
"Disgusting," he said. "Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see
you at the feast later."
"Right," said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.
The empty goblet was still smoking.
"There you go," said Ron. "We got as much as we could carry."
A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry's lap. It was
dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room,
pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time
of their lives.
130
"Thanks," said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps.
"What's Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?"
By the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding
equipment shop, Zonko's Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for
foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.
"The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves,
all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get
there!"
"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free
samples, there's a bit, look --"
"We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three
Broomsticks --"
"Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --"
"What did you do?" said Hermione, looking anxious. "Did you get any work
done?"
"No," said Harry. "Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then
Snape came in...."
He told them all about the goblet. Ron's mouth fell open.
"Lupin drank it?" he gasped. "Is he mad?"
Hermione checked her watch.
"We'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutes
They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still
discussing Snape.
"But if he -- you know" -- Hermione dropped her voice, glancing
nervously around -- "if he was trying to to poison Lupin -- he wouldn't
have done it in front of Harry."
131
"Yeah, maybe," said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed
into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of
candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many
flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy
ceiling like brilliant watersnakes.
The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting
with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry
kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin
looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to
tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes
along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or
were Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts
ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation
gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success
with a reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the
hall, "The dementors send their love, Potter!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that
ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with
students.
"Why isn't anyone going in?" said Ron curiously.
Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be
closed.
"Let me through, please," came Percy's voice, and he came bustling
importantly through the crowd. "What's the holdup here? You can't all
have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I'm Head Boy --"
And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a
chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a
132
suddenly sharp voice, "Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick."
People's heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.
"What's going on?" said Ginny, who had just arrived.
A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the
portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and
Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.
"Oh, my --" Hermione grabbed Harry's arm.
The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so
viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it
had been torn away completely.
Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his
eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying
toward him.
"We need to find her," said Dumbledore. "Professor McGonagall, please go
to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle
for the Fat Lady."
"You'll be lucky!" said a cackling voice.
It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking
delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.
"What do you mean, Peeves?" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves's grin
faded a little. He didn't dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an
oily voice that was no better than his cackle. "Ashamed, Your Headship,
sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her running
through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the
trees. Crying something dreadful," he said happily. "Poor thing," he
added unconvincingly.
"Did she say who did it?" said Dumbledore quietly.
"Oh yes, Professorhead," said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a
133
large bombshell in his arms. "He got very angry when she wouldn't let
him in, you see." Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from
between his own legs. "Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black."
CHAPTER NINE
GRIM DEFEAT
Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall,
where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.
"The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,"
Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick
closed all doors into the hall. "I'm afraid that, for your own safety,
you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand
guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and
Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,"
he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important. "Send
word with one of the ghosts."
Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, "Oh,
yes, you'll be needing..."
One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the
hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor
was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.
"Sleep well," said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.
The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were
telling the rest of the school what had just happened.
"Everyone into their sleeping bags!" shouted Percy. "Come on, now, no
more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!"
"C'mon," Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags
and dragged them into a corner.
"Do you think Black's still in the castle?" Hermione whispered
134
anxiously.
"Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be," said Ron.
"It's very lucky he picked tonight, you know," said Hermione as they
climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on
their elbows to talk. "The one night we weren't in the tower...."
I reckon he's lost track of time, being on the run," said Ron. "Didn't
realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he'd have come bursting in here."
Hermione shuddered.
All around them, people were asking one another the same question: "How
did he get in?"
"Maybe he knows how to Apparate," said a Ravenclaw a few feet away,
"Just appear out of thin air, you know."
"Disguised himself, probably," said a Hufflepuff fifth year. "He
could've flown in," suggested Dean Thomas.
"Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A
History?" said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.
"Probably," said Ron. "Why?"
"Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said
Hermione. "There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people
entering by stealth. You can't just Apparate in here. And I'd like to
see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They're guarding every
single entrance to the grounds. They'd have seen him fly in too. And
Fitch knows all the secret passages, they'll have them covered...."
"The lights are going out now!" Percy shouted. "I want everyone in their
sleeping bags and no more talking!"
The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the
silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the
prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was
135
scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still
filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a
light wind.
Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that
everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students
had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched
him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping
bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away
from Harry, Ron, and Hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep as
Dumbledore's footsteps drew nearer.
"Any sign of him, Professor?" asked Percy in a whisper.
"No. All well here?"
"Everything under control, sir."
"Good. There's no point moving them all now. I've found a temporary
guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You'll be able to move them
back in tomorrow."
"And the Fat Lady, sir?"
"Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she
refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She's
still very distressed, but once she's calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filch
restore her."
Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.
"Headmaster?" It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. "The
whole of the third floor has been searched. He's not there. And Filch
has done the dungeons; nothing there either."
"What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney's room? The
Owlery?"
"All searched."
136
"Very well, Severus. I didn't really expect Black to linger."
"Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?" asked Snape.
Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear,
"Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next."
Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood;
Dumbledore's back was to him, but he could see Percy's face, rapt with
attention, and Snape's profile, which looked angry.
"You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah --
the start of term?" said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as
though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.
"I do, Severus," said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning
in his voice.
"It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the
school without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, you
appointed --"
"I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped
Black enter it," said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the
subject was closed that Snape didn't reply. "I must go down to the
dementors," said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our search
was complete."
"Didn't they want to help, sit?" said Percy.
"Oh yes," said Dumbledore coldly. "But I'm afraid no dementor will cross
the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster."
Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly
and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an
expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.
Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes
open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.
137
"\What was all that about?" Ron mouthed.
The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The
theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder;
Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class
telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering
shrub.
The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and
Replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody
was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging
people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated
passwords, which he changed at least twice a day.
"He's a complete lunatic," said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. "Can't
we get anyone else?"
"None of the other pictures wanted the job," said Percy. "Frightened of
what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough
to volunteer."
Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry's worries. He was now being
closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with
him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother's orders)
was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap
it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a
somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.
"There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter," she said in a
very serious voice. "I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius
Black --"
"I know he's after me," said Harry wearily. "I heard Ron's dad telling
his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic."
Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a
moment or two, then said, "I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you'll
understand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing
138
Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only Your team members,
it's very exposed, Potter --"
"We've got our first match on Saturday!" said Harry, outraged. "I've got
to train, Professor!"
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply
interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she, after
all, who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first Place. He waited,
holding his breath.
"Hmm..." Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at
the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. "Well... goodness
knows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same,
Potter... I'd be happier if a teacher were present. I'll ask Madam Hooch
to oversee your training sessions."
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the
eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before
Saturday's match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.
"We're not playing Slytherin!" he told them, looking very angry.
"Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead."
"Why?" chorused the rest of the team.
"Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured," said Wood,
grinding his teeth furiously. "But it's obvious why they're doing it.
Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage their
chances...."
There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke,
they heard a distant rumble of thunder.
"There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!" said Harry furiously. "He's
faking it!"
"I know that, but we can't prove it," said Wood bitterly, "And we've
been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and
139
instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. They've got
a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --"
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.
"What?" said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.
"He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?" said Angelina.
"Strong and silent," said Katie, and they started to giggle again.
"He's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,"
said Fred impatiently. "I don't know why you're worried, Oliver,
Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the
Snitch in about five minutes, remember?"
"We were playing in completely different conditions!" Wood shouted, his
eyes bulging slightly. "Diggory's put a very strong side together! He's
an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you'd take it like this! We mustn't
relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We
must win!"
"Oliver, calm down!" said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. "We're taking
Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously."
The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain
fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and
classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team
was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.
"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!" he sighed as the gale
outside pounded the windows.
Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match
tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving
him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that
Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the
Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, "Diggory's
got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him --"
140
Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts
classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.
"Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin. I --"
But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher's
desk; it was Snape.
"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten
points from Gryffindor. Sit down."
But Harry didn't move.
"Where's Professor Lupin?" he said.
"He says he is feeling too ill to teach today," said Snape with a
twisted smile. "I believe I told you to sit down?"
But Harry stayed where he was.
"What's wrong with him?"
Snape's black eyes glittered.
"Nothing life-threatening," he said, looking as though he wished it
were. "Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit
down again, it will be fifty."
Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the
class.
"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left
any record of the topics you have covered so far --"
"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,"
said Hermione quickly, "and we're just about to start --"
"Be quiet," said Snape coldly. "I did not ask for information. I was
merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization."
141
"He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,"
said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the
rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.
"You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would
expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows.
Today we shall discuss --"
Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter,
which he must know they hadn't covered.
"Werewolves," said Snape.
"But, sir," said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, "we're
not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --"
"Miss Granger," said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, "I was under the
impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you
all to turn to page 394." He glanced around again. 'All of you! Now!"
With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class
opened their books.
"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and
the true wolf?" said Snape.
Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose
hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.
"Anyone?" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back.
"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the
basic distinction between --"
"We told you," said Parvati suddenly, "we haven't got as far as
werewolves yet, we're still on --"
"Silence!" snarled Snape. "Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a
third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw
one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very
behind you all are...."
142
"Please, sir," said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, "the
werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of
the werewolf --"
"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,"
said Snape coolly. "Five more points from Gryffindor for being an
insufferable know-it-all."
Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with
her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed
Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had
called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione
she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, "You asked us
a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be
told?"
The class knew instantly he'd gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron
slowly, and the room held its breath.
"Detention, Weasley," Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron's.
"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you
will be very sorry indeed."
No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made
notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down
the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor
Lupin.
"Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly
found in Mongolia.... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I
wouldn't have given it three...."
When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.
"You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you
recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the
subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took
this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your
detention."
143
Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited
until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade
about Snape.
"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the
Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job," Harry said to
Hermione. "Why's he got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all because
of the boggart?"
"I don't know," said Hermione pensively. "But I really hope Professor
Lupin gets better soon...."
Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage.
"D'you know what that --" (he called Snape something that made Hermione
say "Ron!") "-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in
the hospital wing. Without magic!" He was breathing deeply, his fists
clenched. "Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? He
could have finished him off for us!"
Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till
dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him.
Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright
-- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in
his ear.
"What did you do that for?" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his
cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.
Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past
four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but
it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of
the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the
castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden
Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling
through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got
up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out
of the dormitory.
144
As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent
down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and
drag him outside.
"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you," Harry told Crookshanks
suspiciously. "There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and
chase them. Go on," he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral
staircase with his foot. "Leave Scabbers alone."
The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew
better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches
weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was
starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory
to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than
Harry. Seekers were usually light
and speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather
because he was less likely to be blown off course.
Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up
every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up
the boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time
for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.
"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!" yelled Sir Cadogan.
"Oh, shut up," Harry yawned.
He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'd
started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.
"It's going to be a tough one," said Wood, who wasn't eating anything.
"Stop worrying, Oliver," said Alicia soothingly, "we don't mind a bit of
rain."
But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity
of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as
usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads
145
bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their
hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an
enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual
pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He tried to speak several times,
made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned
them to follow him.
The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out
onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it over
the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses.
How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?
The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field,
wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other and
shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he had
lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words,
"Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a
squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her
whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant
they were off
Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He
held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.
Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able
to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and
forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no
idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn't hear the
commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks
and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by
a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he
hadn't seen them coming.
He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his
broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided
to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing
whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the
146
rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart....
With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's
whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick
rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the
mud.
"I called for time-out!" Wood roared at his team. "Come on, under here
--"
They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took
off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.
"What's the score?"
"We're fifty points up," said Wood, "but unless we get the Snitch soon,
we'll be playing into the night."
"I've got no chance with these on," Harry said exasperatedly, waving his
glasses.
At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding
her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!"
He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione
tapped them with her wand and said, "Impervius!"
"There!" she said, handing them back to Harry. "They'll repel water!"
Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.
"Brilliant!" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the
crowd. "Okay, team, let's go for it!"
Hermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold,
still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of
fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air,
staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking
147
beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction....
There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked
lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get
the Snitch quickly -
He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at
that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and
Harry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette of
an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky,
motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.
Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a
few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back
into the stands. The dog had vanished.
"Harry!" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts.
"Harry, behind you!"
Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and
a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them
-
With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and
zoomed toward the Snitch.
"Come on!" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.
'Taster!"
But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the
stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It
was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone
suddenly deaf -- what was going on?
And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him,
just as he became aware of something moving on the field below...
Before he'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch
and looked down.
148
At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him,
were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising
in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again....
Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...
"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!"
"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now...."
"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --"
Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain.... What was he
doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going to
die.... She was going to be murdered....
He was falling, falling through the icy mist.
"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....
A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no
more.
"Lucky the ground was so soft."
"I thought he was dead for sure."
"But he didn't even break his glasses."
Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense
whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there,
or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every
inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.
"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life."
Scariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ...
screaming...
Harry's eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The
Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was
149
gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as
though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.
"Harry!" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud.
"How're you feeling?"
It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning --
the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...
"What happened?" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.
"You fell off," said Fred. "Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?"
"We thought you'd died," said Alicia, who was shaking.
Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.
"But the match," said Harry. "What happened? Are we doing a replay?"
No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.
"We didn't -- lose?"
"Diggory got the Snitch," said George. "Just after you fell. He didn't
realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the
ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and
square... even Wood admits it."
"Where is Wood?" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.
"Still in the showers," said Fred. "We think he's trying to drown
himself."
Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred
grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.
"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before."
"There had to be one time you didn't get it," said George.
150
"It's not over yet," said Fred. "We lost by a hundred points"
"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and
Slytherin --."
"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points," said
George.
"But if they beat Ravenclaw..."
"No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against
Hufflepuff..."
"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way."
Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time
ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.
After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to
leave him in peace.
"We'll come and see you later," Fred told him. "Don't beat yourself up,
Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had."
The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the
door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to
Harry's bed.
"Dumbledore was really angry," Hermione said in a quaking voice. "I've
never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell,
waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.
Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.
They left the stadium right away... He was furious they'd come onto the
grounds. We heard him --"
"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher," said Ron. "And walked up to
school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --"
His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what
the dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up
151
and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly
cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.
"Did someone get my Nimbus?"
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.
"Er --"
"What?" said Harry, looking from one to the other.
"Well... when you fell off, it got blown away," said Hermione
hesitantly.
"And?"
"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow."
Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree
that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.
"And?" he said, dreading the answer.
"Well, you know the Whomping Willow," said Ron. "It -- it doesn't like
being hit."
"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said
Hermione in a very small voice.
Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down,
and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the
only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.
CHAPTER TEN
THE MARAUDER'S MAP
Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the
rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't let
her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He
152
knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but
Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best
friends.
He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent
him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and
Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she
had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his
bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this
time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of
voice) that he didn't blame
him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at
night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better,
because they knew only half of what was troubling him.
He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione,
because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact
remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances
had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly
been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his
broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was
he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the
beast?
And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every
time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but
no one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard
echoes in their head of their dying parents.
Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had
heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours
in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of
moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard
the last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him,
Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he murdered
her.... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted
hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his
153
mother's voice.
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on
Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he had
to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with
glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and
celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited
imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their
next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron
finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy,
which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from
Gryffindor.
"If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving
off," said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch.
"Check who's in there, Hermione."
Hermione peered around the classroom door.
"It's okay!"
Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had
been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were
dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as
they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of
complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill.
"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?"
"We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!"
"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?" Lupin asked,
frowning slightly.
The babble broke out again.
"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --"
"-- two rolls of parchment!"
154
Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.
"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the
essay."
"Oh no," said Hermione, looking very disappointed. "I've already
finished it!"
They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a
glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who
looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and
harmless looking.
"Lures travelers into bogs," said Professor Lupin as they took notes.
"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people
follow the light -- then --"
The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the
door, Harry among them, but --
"Wait a moment, Harry," Lupin called. "I'd like a word."
Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's
box with a cloth.
"I heard about the match," said Lupin, turning back to his desk and
starting to pile books into his briefcase, "and I'm sorry about your
broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?"
"No," said Harry. "The tree smashed it to bits."
Lupin sighed.
"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at
Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch
the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye,
and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance."
155
"Did you hear about the dementors too?" said Harry with difficulty.
Lupin looked at him quickly.
"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that
angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his
refusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the
reason you fell?"
"Yes," said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask
burst from him before he could stop himself." Why? Why do they affect me
like that? Am I just --?"
"It has nothing to do with weakness," said Professor Lupin sharply, as
though he had read Harry's mind. "The dementors affect you worse than
the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't
have."
A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating
Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face.
"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They
infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,
they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even
Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a
dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out
of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce
you to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left with
nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that
happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.
You have nothing to feel ashamed of."
"When they get near me --" Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat
tight. "I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum."
Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's
shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then
--
"Why did they have to come to the match?" said Harry bitterly.
156
"They're getting hungry," said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with
a snap. "Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of
human prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the large
crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions
running high... it was their idea of a feast."
"Azkaban must be terrible," Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.
"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't
need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all
trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought.
Most of them go mad within weeks."
"But Sirius Black escaped from them," Harry said slowly. "He got
away..."
Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to
catch it.
"Yes," he said, straightening up, "Black must have found a way to fight
them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to
drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long...."
"You made that dementor on the train back off," said Harry suddenly.
"There are -- certain defenses one can use," said Lupin. "But there was
only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult
it becomes to resist."
"What defenses?" said Harry at once. "Can you teach me?"
"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the
contrary..."
"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able
to fight them --"
Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said,
"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next
157
term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very
inconvenient time to fall ill."
What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought
that he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the fact
that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end
of November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not
out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose
another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked
his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into
December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.
Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the
entrances.
Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a
dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning
covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of
Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had
already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out
to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing
their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to
remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand
two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the
library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company,
and he was very grateful.
To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade
trip on the very last weekend of the term.
"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!" said Hermione. "Mum and
Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!"
Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind
again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided
to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding
one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star,
which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his
own.
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron
158
and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the
marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow
had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still
and quiet.
"Psst -- Harry!"
He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and
George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed
witch.
"What are you doing?" said Harry curiously. "How come you're not going
to Hogsmeade?"
"We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go," said Fred,
with a mysterious wink. "Come in here...."
He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.
Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly
and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.
"Early Christmas present for you, Harry," he said.
Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it
on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of
parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and
George's jokes, stared at it.
"What's that supposed to be?"
"This, Harry, is the secret of our success," said George, patting the
parchment fondly.
"It's a wrench, giving it to you," said Fred, "but we decided last
night, your need's greater than ours."
"Anyway, we know it by heart," said George. "We bequeath it to you. We
don't really need it anymore."
"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?" said Harry.
159
"A bit of old parchment!" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as
though Harry had mortally offended him. "Explain, George."
"Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and
innocent --"
Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been
innocent.
"Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother
with Filch."
"We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason
--"
"So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the
usual --" detention disembowelment and we couldn't help noticing a
drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly
Dangerous.
"Don't tell me --" said Harry, starting to grin.
"Well, what would you've done?" said Fred. "George caused a diversion by
dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed --
this."
"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know," said George. "We don't reckon
Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was,
though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it."
"And you know how to work it?"
"Oh yes," said Fred, smirking. "This little beauty's taught us more than
all the teachers in this school."
"You're winding me up," said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of
parchment.
"Oh, are we?" said George.
160
He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, "I
solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from the
point that George's wand had touched. They joined each other, they
crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words
began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that
proclaimed:
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs
Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE
MARAUDER'S MAP
It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds.
But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it,
each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent
over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor
Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was
prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently
bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and
down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them
seemed to lead -
"Right into Hogsmeade," said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four" -- he
pointed them out -- "but we're sure we're the only ones who know about
these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor.
We used it until last winter, but it's caved in -- completely blocked.
And we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the Whomping
Willow's planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one
leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We've used it loads of times.
And as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside this room,
through that one-eyed old crone's hump."
"Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs," sighed George, patting the
heading of the map. "We owe them so much."
161
"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,"
said Fred solemnly.
"Right," said George briskly. "Don't forget to wipe it after you've used
it or anyone can read it," Fred said warningly.
"Just tap it again and say, 'Mischief managed!' And it'll go blank."
"So, young Harry," said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy,
"mind you behave yourself."
"See you in Honeydukes," said George, winking.
They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.
Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink
Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If
Filch really didn't know... he wouldn't have to pass the dementors at
all....
But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had
once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.
Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where
it keeps its brain.
This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been
warning against.... Aids for Magical Mischief Makers... but then, Harry
reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn't as
though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and
George had been using it for years without anything horrible
happening....
Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.
Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map,
stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom.
He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very
carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the
162
one-eyed witch.
What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his
astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry
Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was
standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.
Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the
witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and
tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The
tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside
said, "Dissendium."
"Dissendium!" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.
At once, the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin
person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the
map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed
himself forward.
He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then
landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was
pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, "Lumos! " and saw that he was
in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it
with the tip of his wand, and muttered, "Mischief managed!" The map went
blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then,
heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.
The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit
than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on
the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.
It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him.
After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry
sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.
Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which
rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began
to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he
163
climbed, watching his feet.... Then, without warning, his head hit
something hard.
It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his
head, listening. He couldn't hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he
pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.
He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry
climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it -- it blended so perfectly
with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry
crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could
definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the
opening and shutting of a door.
Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer
at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.
"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out
--" said a woman's voice.
A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an
enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard the man
shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get another
chance --
Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed
the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald
head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs,
slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes
-- he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.
Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked
twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a
laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face
if he could see where Harry was now.
There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets
imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut
ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of
chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans,
164
and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron
had mentioned; along yet another wall were "Special Effects" -- sweets:
Droobles Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored
bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery
Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps ("breathe fire for
your friends!"), Ice Mice ("hear your teeth chatter and squeak!"),
peppermint creams shaped like toads ("hop realistically in the
stomach!"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons.
Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign
hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and
Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored
lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.
"Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I
expect," Hermione was saying.
"How about these?" said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under
Hermione's nose.
"Definitely not," said Harry.
Ron nearly dropped the jar.
"Harry!" squealed Hermione. "What are you doing here? How -- how did you
--?"
"Wow!" said Ron, looking very impressed, "you've learned to Apparate!"
"'Course I haven't," said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of
the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder's
Map.
"How come Fred and George never gave it to me!" said Ron, outraged. "I'm
their brother!"
"But Harry isn't going to keep it!" said Hermione, as though the idea
were ludicrous. "He's going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall,
aren't you, Harry?"
165
"No, I'm not!" said Harry.
"Are you mad?" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. "Hand in something that
good?"
"If I hand it in, I'll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred
and George had nicked it!"
"But what about Sirius Black?" Hermione hissed. "He could be using one
of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have
got to know!"
"He can't be getting in through a passage," said Harry quickly. "There
are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch
already knows about four of them. And of the other three -- one of
them's caved in, so no one can get through it. one of them's got the
Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it.
And the one I just came through -well - - it's really hard to see the
entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there..."
Harry hesistated. What if Black did know the passage was there?
Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice
pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.
--------BY ORDER OF -------- THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Customers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be
patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This
measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and
will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore
advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall.
Merry Christmas!
"See?" said Ron quietly. "I'd like to see Black try and break into
Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway,
Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn't they?
They live over the shop!"
166
"Yes, but but --" Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another
problem. "Look, Harry still shouldn't be coming into Hogsmeade. He
hasn't got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he'll be in so much
trouble! And it's not nightfall yet -- what if Sirius Black turns up
today? Now?"
"He'd have a job spotting Harry in this," said Ron, nodding through the
mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. "Come on, Hermione, it's
Christmas. Harry deserves a break."
Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.
"Are you going to report me?" Harry asked her, grinning.
"Oh -- of course not -- but honestly, Harry --"
"Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?" said Ron, grabbing him and leading
him over to their barrel. "And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred
gave me one of those when I was seven -- it burnt a hole right through
my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick." Ron stared
broodingly into the Acid Pop box. "Reckon Fred'd take a bit of Cockroach
Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?"
When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them
left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and
shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly
wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the
trees.
Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn't have his cloak. They
headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione
shouting through their scarves.
"That's the post office
"Zonko's is up there --"
"We could go up to the Shrieking Shack
167
"Tell you what," said Ron, his teeth chattering, "shall we go for a
butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?"
Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were
freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering
the tiny inn.
It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman
with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock' up at the bar.
"That's Madam Rosmerta," said Ron. "I'll get the drinks, shall I?" he
added, going slightly red.
Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, ,,her, there
was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas
tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes
later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.
"Merry Christmas!" he said happily, raising his tankard.
Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted and
seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside.
A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had
opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked.
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a
flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in
conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a
pinstriped cloak -- Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of
Harry's head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping
with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty
tankard and watched the teachers' and Fudge's feet move toward the bar,
pause, then turn and walk right toward him.
Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, Mobiliarbus!"
168
The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground,
drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of their
table, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches,
Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside
theirs, then heard the grunts and sighs If the teachers and minister as
they sat down.
Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels,
and heard a woman's voice. "A small gillywater --"
"Mine," said Professor McGonagall's voice.
"Four pints of mulled mead --"
"Ta, Rosmerta," said Hagrid.
"A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella --"
"Mmm!" said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.
"So you'll be the red currant rum, Minister."
"Thank you, Rosmerta, m'dear," said Fudge's voice. "Lovely to see you
again, I must say. Have one yourself, won't you? Come and join us...."
"Well, thank you very much, Minister."
Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart
was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn't it occurred to him
that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& And how long
were they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back into
Honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight.... Hermione's leg
gave a nervous twitch next to him.
"So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?" came Madam
Rosmerta's voice.
Harry saw the lower part of Fudge's thick body twist in his chair as
though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet
voice, "What else, m'dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what
169
happened up at the school at Halloween?"
I did hear a rumor," admitted Madam Rosmerta.
"Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?" said Professor McGonagall
exasperatedly.
"Do you think Blacks still in the area, Minister?" whispered Madam
Rosmerta.
"I'm sure of it," said Fudge shortly.
"You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjce?"
said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. "Scared all my
customers away... It's very bad for business, Minister."
"Rosmerta, dear, I don't like them any more than you do," said Fudge
uncomfortably. "Necessary precaution... unfortunate, but there YOU
are.... I've just met some of them. They're in a fury against Dumbledore
-- he won't let them inside the castle grounds."
"I should think not," said Professor McGonagall sharply. "How are we
supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?"
"Hear, hear!" squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling
a foot from the ground.
"All the same," demurred Fudge, "they are here to protect you all from
something much worse.... We all know what Black's capable of..."
"Do you know, I still have trouble believing it," said Madam Rosmerta
thoughtfully. "Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius
Black was the last I'd have thought... I mean, I remember him when he
was a boy at Hogwarts. If you'd told me then what he was going to
become, I'd have said you'd had too much mead."
"You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta," said Fudge gruffly. "The
worst he did isn't widely known."
"The worst?" said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity, "Worse
170
than murdering all those poor people, you mean?"
"I certainly do," said Fudge.
"I ca'A believe that. What could possibly be worse?" "You say you
remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta," mur- mured Professor McGonagall.
"Do you remember who his-best friend was?"
"Naturally," said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. "Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here --
ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and
James Potter!"
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
"Precisely," said Professor McGonagall. "Black and Potter. Ringleaders
of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally
bright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of
troublemakers --"
"I dunno," chuckled Hagrid. "Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a
run fer their money."
"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!" chimed in Professor
Flitwick. "Inseparable!"
"Of course they were," said Fudge. "Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry
has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him."
"Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?" whispered
Madam Rosmerta.
"Worse even than that, rn'dear...." Fudge dropped his voice and
proceeded in a sort of low rumble. "Not many people are aware that the
Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course
working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies.
One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He
advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an
171
easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance
was the Fidelius Charm."
"How does that work?" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest.
Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.
"An immensely complex spell," he said squeakily, "involving the magical
concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is
hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth
impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to
divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who
could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and
never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their
sitting room window!"
"So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?" whispered Madam Rosmerta.
"Naturally," said Professor McGonagall. "James Potter told Dumbledore
that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was
planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained
worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper
himself."
"He suspected Black?" gasped Madam Rosmerta.
"He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping
You-Know-Who informed of their movements," said Professor McGonagall
darkly. "Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side
had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to
You-Know-Who."
"But James Potter insisted on using Black?"
"He did," said Fudge heavily. "And then, barely a week after the
Fidelius Charm had been performed --" "Black betrayed them?" breathed
Madam Rosmerta.
"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready
to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have
planned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know,
172
You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone,
horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position
indeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had
shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it
--"
"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar
went quiet.
"Shh!" said Professor McGonagall.
"I met him!" growled Hagrid. "I musta bin the last ter see him before he
killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an'
James's house after they was killed! jus' got him outta the ruins, poor
little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an' his parents
dead... an' Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin' motorbike he used ter
ride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin' there. I didn' know he'd
bin Lily an' James's Secret-Keeper. Thought he'd jus' heard the news o'
You-Know-Who's attack an' come ter see what he could do. White an'
shakin', he was. An' yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN'
TRAITOR!" Hagrid roared.
"Hagrid, please!" said Professor McGonagall. "Keep your voice down!"
"How was I ter know he wasn' upset abou' Lily an' James? It was
You-Know-Who he cared abou'! An' then he says, 'Give Harry ter me,
Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him --' Ha! But I'd had me
orders from Dumbledore, an' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was
ter go ter his aunt an' uncle's. Black argued, but in the end he gave
in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. 'I won't need it
anymore,' he says.
"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. He loved that
motorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' he need it
anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he'd bin
the Potters' Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin' ter have ter run fer
it that night, knew it was a matter o' hours before the Ministry was
after him.
"But what if I'd given Harry to him, eh? I bet he'd 've pitched him off
173
the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes' friends' son! But when a wizard
goes over ter the Dark Side, there's nothin' and no one that matters to
em anymore...."
A long silence followed Hagrid's story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with
some satisfaction, "But he didn't manage to disappear, did he? The
Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!"
"Alas, if only we had," said Fudge bitterly. "It was not we who found
him. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters' friends.
Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the
Potters' Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself."
"Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after
them at Hogwarts?" said Madam Rosmerta.
"Hero-worshipped Black and Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "Never
quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather ,harp with him.
You can imagine how I -how I regret that now..." She sounded as though
she had a sudden head cold.
"There, now, Minerva," said Fudge kindly, "Pettigrew died a hero's
death. Eyewitnesses -- Muggles, of course, we wiped their, memories
later -- told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing,
'Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?' And then he went for his wand.
Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens...."
Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, "Stupid boy ...
foolish boy... he was always hopeless at dueling... should have left it
to the Ministry...."
"I tell yeh, if I'd got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I
wouldn't 've messed around with wands -- I'd 've ripped him limb -- from
-- limb," Hagrid growled.
"You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid," said Fudge sharply.
"Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad
would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was
Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time,
and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those
174
people. I -- I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A
crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer
below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there
laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him... a heap of
bloodstained robes and a few -- a few fragments --"
Fudge's voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being
blown.
"Well, there you have it, Rosmerta," said Fudge thickly. "Black was
taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement 'Squad and
Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was
some comfort to his poor mother. Blades been in Azkaban ever since."
Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.
"Is it true he's mad, Minister?"
"I wish I could say that he was," said Fudge slowly. "I certainly
believe his master's defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of
Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and
desperate man -- cruel... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last
inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit
muttering to themselves in the dark; there's no sense in them... but I
was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me.
It was unnerving. You'd have thought he was merely bored -- asked if I'd
finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the
crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors
seemed to be having on him -- and he was one of the most heavily guarded
in the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night."
"But what do you think he's broken out to do?" said Madam Rosmerta.
"Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is
he?"
I daresay that is his -- er -- eventual plan," said Fudge evasively.
"But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who
alone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devoted
servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again...."
175
There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their
glass.
"You know, Cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he'd better
head back up to the castle," said Professor McGonagall.
One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their
owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta's
glittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the Three
Broomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the
teachers had disappeared.
"Harry?"
Ron's and Hermione's faces appeared under the table. They were both
staring at him, lost for words.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
THE FIREBOLT
Harry didn't have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back
into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once
more. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at
all, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was
still pounding with the conversation he had just heard.
Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius
Fudge... why hadn't anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry's parents
had died because their best friend had betrayed them?
Ron and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not
daring to talk about what they'd overheard, because Percy was sitting
close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it
was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit
of end- of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn't want Fred and George
asking him whether he'd reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to
the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He
pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for -- the
leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was
176
full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his
bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages,
searching, until...
He stopped on a picture of his parents' wedding day. There was his
father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had
inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight
with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ... that must be him.
Their best man... Harry had never given him a thought before.
If he hadn't known it was the same person, he would never have guessed
it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn't sunken and waxy,
but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for
Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the
deaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing
twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him
unrecognizable?
But the dementors don't affect him, Harry thought, staring into the
handsome, laughing face. He doesn't have to hear my Min screaming if
they get too close -
Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his
cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the
hangings were hiding him from view.
The dormitory door opened.
"Harry?" said Ron's voice uncertainly.
But Harry still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and
rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open.
A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry
like poison. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as
though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He
watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius
Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a
thousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black's voice
might sound like) a low, excited mutter. "It has happened, My Lord...
177
the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper and then came another
voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head
whenever the dementors drew near....
"Harry, you -- you look terrible."
Harry hadn't gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the
dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a
common room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating a
Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had spread
her homework over three tables.
"Where is everyone?" said Harry.
"Gone! It's the first day of the holidays, remember?" said Ron, watching
Harry closely. "It's nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you
up in a minute."
Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling
outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire
like a large, ginger rug.
"You really don' look well, you know," Hermione said, peering anxiously
into his face.
"I'm fine," said Harry.
"Harry, listen," said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, you must be
really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you
mustn't go doing anything stupid."
"Like what?" said Harry.
"Like trying to go after Black," said Ron sharply.
Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been
asleep. He didn't say anything.
"You won't, will you, Harry?" said Hermione.
178
"Because Black's not worth dying for," said Ron.
Harry looked at them. They didn't seem to understand at all.
"D'you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?"
Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. "I can hear my
mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you'd heard your mum
screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it in
a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of
hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her --"
"There's nothing you can do!" said Hermione, looking stricken. "The
dementors will catch Black and he'll go back to Azkaban and -- and serve
him right!"
"You heard what Fudge said. Black isn't affected by Azkaban like normal
people are. It's not a punishment for him like it is for the others."
"So what are you saying?" said Ron, looking very tense. "You want to --
to kill Black or something?"
"Don't be silly," said Herinione in a panicky voice. "Harry doesn't want
to kill anyone, do you, Harry?"
Again, Harry didn't answer. He didn't know what he wanted to do. All he
knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was
almost more than he could stand.
Malfoy knows," he said abruptly. "Remember what he said to me in
Potions? 'If it was me, I'd hunt him down myself... I'd want revenge.
"You're going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours?" said Ron
furiously. "Listen... you know what Pettigrew's mother got back after
Black had finished with him? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, First
Class, and Pettigrew's finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him
they could find. Black's a madman, Harry, and he's dangerous --"
"Malfoy's dad must have told him," said Harry, ignoring Ron. "He was
right in Voldemort's inner circle --"
179
"Say You-Know-Who, will you?" interjected Ron angrily.
"-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --"
"-- and Malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like
Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy's just hoping you'll get Yourself killed
before he has to play you at Quidditch."
"Harry, please," said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, "Please
be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don't Put
Yourself in danger, it's what Black wants.... Oh, Harry, you'd be
Playing right into Black's hands if you went looking for him. Your mum
and dad wouldn't want you to get hurt, would they? They'd never want you
to go looking for Black!"
"I'll never know what they'd have wanted, because thanks to Black, I've
never spoken to them," said Harry shortly.
There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing
his claws. Ron's pocket quivered.
"Look," said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject,
"it's the holidays! It's nearly Christmas! Let's -- let's go down and
see Hagrid. We haven't visited him for ages!"
"No!" said Hermione quickly. "Harry isn't supposed to leave the castle,
Ron --"
"Yeah, let's go," said Harry, sitting up, "and I can ask him how come he
never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!"
Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn't what Ron had had in
mind.
"Or we could have a game of chess, he said hastily, "or Gobstones. Percy
left a set --"
"No, let's visit Hagrid," said Harry firmly.
So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the
180
portrait hole ("Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!"), down
through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors.
They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the
glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks
soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been
enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid's cabin looked
like an iced cake.
Ron knocked, but there was no answer.
"He's not out, is he?" said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.
Ron had his ear to the door.
"There's a weird noise," he said. "Listen -- is that Fang?"
Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin
came a series of low, throbbing moans.
"Think we'd better go and get someone?" said Ron nervously.
"Hagrid!" called Harry, thumping the door. "Hagrid, are you in there.
There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid
stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the
front of his leather vest.
"YWve heard?" he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry's neck.
Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no
laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid's weight, was
rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and
heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered
into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his
face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.
"Hagrid, what is it?" said Hermione, aghast.
Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.
181
"What's this, Hagrid?"
Hagrid's sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who
Picked it up and read aloud:
Dear Mr. Hagrid,
Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in
your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that
you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.
"Well, that's okay then, Hagrid!" said Ron, clapping Hagrid oil the
shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic
hands, inviting Harry to read on.
However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question.
We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy,
and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April
20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the
Committee's offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the
hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship...
There followed a list of the school governors.
"Oh," said Ron. "But you said Buckbeak isn't a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I
bet he'll get off
"Yeh don' know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o'
Dangerous Creatures!" choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.
"They've got it in fer interestin' creatures!"
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid's cabin made Harry, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
"I couldn' leave him tied up out there in the snow!" choked Hagrid. "All
on his own! At Christmas."
182
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called "interesting creatures" and
other people called "terrifying monsters." Or' the other hand, there
didn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid's
usual standards, he was positively cute.
"You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid," said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid's massive forearm. "I'm sure
you can prove Buckbeak is safe."
"Won't make no diff'rence!" sobbed Hagrid. "Them Disposal devils,
they're all in Lucius Malfoy's pocket! Scared o' him! Ad if I lose the
case, Buckbeak --"
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail
and lurched forward, his face in his arms.
"What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?" said Harry.
"He's done more'n enough fer me already," groaned Hagrid. "Got enough on
his plate what with keepin' them dementors outta the castle, an' Sirius
Black lurkin' around --"
Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to
start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. But
Harry couldn't bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so
miserable and scared.
"Listen, Hagrid," he said, "you can't give up. Hermione's right, You
just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --"
"I'm sure I've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting," said Hermione
thoughtfully, "where the hippogriff got off I'll look it up for you,
Hagrid, and see exactly what happened."
Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to
help them.
"Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?" said Ron.
183
Harry stared at him.
"It's what my mum does whenever someone's upset," Ron muttered,
shrugging.
At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea
in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a
tablecloth and said, "Yer right. I can' afford to go ter pieces. Gotta
pull meself together.....
Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his
head on Hagrid's knee.
"I've not bin meself lately," said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand
and mopping his face with the other. "Worried abou' Buckbeak, an' no one
likin' me classes --"
"We do like them!" lied Hermione at once.
"Yeah, they're great!" said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table.
"Er -- how are the flobberworms?"
"Dead," said Hagrid gloomily. "Too much lettuce."
"Oh no!" said Ron, his lip twitching.
"An' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an' all," said Hagrid,
with a sudden shudder. "Gotta walk past 'em ev'ry time I want a drink in
the Three Broomsticks. 'S like bein' back in Azkaban --"
He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him
breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in
Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, "Is it awful in
there, Hagrid?"
"Yeh've no idea," said Hagrid quietly. "Never bin anywhere like it.
Thought I was goin' mad. Kep' goin' over horrible stuff in me mind...
the day I got expelled from Hogwarts... day me dad died... day I had ter
let Norbert go...."
184
His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once
won in a game of cards.
"Yeh can' really remember who yeh are after a while. An' yeh can' really
see the point o' livin' at all. I used ter hope I'd jus' die in me
sleep. When they let me out, it was like bein' born again, ev'rythin' I
came floodin' back, it was the bes' feelin' in the world. Mind, the
dementors weren't keen on lettin' me go."
"But you were innocent!" said Hermione.
Hagrid snorted.
"Think that matters to them? They don' care. Long as they've got a
couple o' hundred humans stuck there with 'em, so they can leech all the
happiness out of 'em, they don' give a damn who's guilty an' who's not."
Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said
quietly, "Thought o' jus' letting Buckbeak go... tryin' ter make him fly
away... but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go inter
hidin'? An' -an' I'm scared o' breakin' the law...." He looked up at
them, tears leaking down his face again. "I don' ever want ter go back
ter Azkaban."
The trip to Hagrid's, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the
effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means
forgotten about Black, he couldn't brood constantly on revenge if he
wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to the
library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with
books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of them
sat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty
volumes about famous cases If marauding beasts, speaking occasionally
when they ran across something relevant.
"Here's something... there was a case in 1722... but the hippogriff was
convicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that's disgusting --"
"This might help, look -- a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they
let the manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was
185
too scared to go near it."
Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas
decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the
students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe
were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside
every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve
Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious
smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had
grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of
Ron's pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.
On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him.
"Oy! Presents!"
Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the
semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had
appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.
'Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you've got one.
Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the
Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince
pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all
these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.
"What's that?" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of
maroon socks in his hand.
"Dunno..."
Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming
broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and
jumped off his bed for a closer look.
"I don't believe it," he said hoarsely.
It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see
every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He
186
could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at
exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the
golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the
perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.
"Who sent it to you?" said Ron in a hushed voice.
"Look and see if there's a card," said Harry.
Ron ripped apart the Firebolt's wrappings.
"Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?"
"Well," said Harry, feeling stunned, "I'm betting it wasn't the
Dursleys."
I bet it was Dumbledore," said Ron, now walking around and around the
Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. "He sent you the Invisibility
Cloak anonymously...."
"That was my dad's, though," said Harry. "Dumbledore was just Passing it
on to me. He wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can't go
giving students stuff like this --"
"That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!" said Ron. "In case some
git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry" -- Ron gave a great
whoop of laughter -- "Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He'll be
sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!"
"I can't believe this," Harry muttered, running a hand along the
Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his head off at the
thought of Malfoy. "Who -?"
"I know," said Ron, controlling himself, "I know who it could've been --
Lupin!"
"What?" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself "Lupin? Listen, if he
had this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes."
"Yeah, but he likes you," said Ron. "And he was away when your Nimbus
187
got smashed, and he might've heard about it and decided to visit Diagon
Alley and get this for you --"
"What d'you mean, he was away?" said Harry. "He was ill when I was
playing in that match."
"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing," said Ron. "I was there, cleaning
out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?"
Harry frowned at Ron.
"I can't see Lupin affording something like this."
"What're you two laughing about?"
Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying
Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied
around his neck.
"Don't bring him in here!" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from
the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.
But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's
empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.
"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?"
"No idea," said Harry. "There wasn't a card or anything with it."
To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or
intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her
lip.
"What's the matter with you?" said Ron.
"I don't know," said Hermione slowly, "but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I
mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?"
Ron sighed exasperatedly.
188
"It's the best broom there is, Hermione," he said.
"So it must've been really expensive...."
"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together," said
Ron happily.
"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even
tell him they'd sent it?" said Hermione.
"Who cares?" said Ron impatiently. "Listen, Harry, can I have a go on
it? Can I?"
"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!" said Hermione
shrilly.
Harry and Ron looked at her.
"What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?" said
Ron.
But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed,
right at Ron's chest.
"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws
ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his
shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at
Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it
over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.
Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was
filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle
Vernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.
I forgot about that!" Harry said, bending down and picking up the
Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....
The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was
hissing and spitting at it.
189
"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione," said Ron furiously,
sitting on Harry's bed nursing his toe. "Can't you shut that thing up?"
he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks's
yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.
Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back
into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans of
pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a while
since Harry had seen him out of Ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantly
surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny;
patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too
"He's not looking too good, is he?" Harry said.
"It's stress!" said Ron. "He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left
him alone!"
But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said
about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unless
Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of
his life. And despite Ron's frequent conplaints that Scabbers was both
boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers
died.
Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor
common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her
dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was
still fuming about Crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry
gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to
examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room
with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she
didn't say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though
it too had been criticizing her cat.
At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House
tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table,
set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore,
McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch,
the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a
very old and rather moldy- looking tailcoat. There were only three other
190
students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced
Slytherin fifth year.
"Merry Christmas!" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
approached the table. "As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to
use the House tables.... Sit down, sit down!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.
"Crackers!" said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a
large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged.
With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,
pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture.
Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned;
Snape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who
swapped it for his wizard's hat at once.
"Dig in!" he advised the table, beaming around.
As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great
Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as
though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the
occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized
dragonfly.
"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!" said Dumbledore, standing up.
"I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster," said Professor Trelawney in
her mistiest, most faraway voice, "and to my astonishment, I saw myself
abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to
refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I
do beg you to forgive my lateness...."
"Certainly, certainly," said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. "Let me
draw you up a chair --"
And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved
for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape
and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her
191
enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered
a kind of soft scream.
I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen!
Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine
together, the first to rise will be the first to die!"
"We'll risk it, Sibyll," said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. "Do sit
down, the turkey's getting stone cold."
Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty
chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a
thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon
into the nearest tureen.
"Tripe, Sibyll?"
Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once
more and said, "But where is dear Professor Lupin?"
"I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again," said Dumbledore, indicating
that everybody should start serving themselves. "Most unfortunate that
it should happen on Christmas Day."
"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?" said Professor McGonagall,
her eyebrows raised.
Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.
"Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she said quietly. "But one does not
parade the fact that one is All- Knowing. I frequently act as though I
am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.
"That explains a great deal," said Professor McGonagall tartly.
Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.
"If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will
not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is
short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --"
192
"Imagine that," said Professor McGonagall dryly.
I doubt," said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice,
which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's
conversation, "that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus,
you've made the potion for him again?"
"Yes, Headmaster," said Snape. "W -- what?" said Harry, scrambling to
his feet. "Why?"
"It will need to be checked for jinxes," said Professor McGonagall. "Of
course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick
will strip it down --"
"Strip it down?" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.
"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks," said Professor McGonagall.
"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free."
"There's nothing wrong with it!" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly.
"Honestly, Professor --"
"You can't know that, Potter," said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly,
"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of
the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I
shall keep you informed."
Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of
the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after
her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron,
however, rounded on Hermione.
"What did you go running to McGonagall for?
Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood
up and faced Ron defiantly.
"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that
that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!"
193
CHAPTER TWELVE
THE PATRONUS
Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him from
being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the
world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he
didn't know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that
there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state
would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx
tests?
Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the
stripping-down of a brand- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal
damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the
best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had
taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back.
All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly
after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again.
Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started.
"Had a good Christmas?" he said, and then, without waiting for an
answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, "I've been, doing some
thinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If the
dementors come to the next one... I mean... we can't afford you to --
well --"
Wood broke off, looking awkward.
"I'm working on it," said Harry quickly. "Professor Lupin said he'd
train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He
said he'd have time after Christmas."
"Ah," said Wood, his expression clearing. "Well, in that case -- I
really didn't want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a
new broom yet?"
"No," said Harry.
194
"What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that
Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!"
"He got a Firebolt for Christmas," said Ron.
"A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?"
"Don't get excited, Oliver," said Harry gloomily. "I haven't got it
anymore. It was confiscated." And he explained all about how the
Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes.
"Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?"
"Sirius Black" Harry said wearily. "He's supposed to be after me. So
McGonagall reckons he might have sent it."
Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his
Seeker, Wood said, "But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! He's on
the run! The whole country's on the lookout for him! How could he just
walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?"
"I know," said Harry, "but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --"
Wood went pale.
"I'll go and talk to her, Harry," he promised. "I'll make her see
reason.... A Firebolt... a real Firebolt, on our team... She wants
Gryffindor to win as much as we do.... I'll make her see sense. A
Firebolt..."
Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like
doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning,
but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their
enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood
and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards
scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first
Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney
was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry
that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.
195
It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to;
after his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his
anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.
"Ah yes," said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end
of class. "Let me see... how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening?
The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.... I'll have to
think carefully about how we're going to do this.... We can't bring a
real dementor into the castle to practice on...."
"Still looks ill, doesn't he?" said Ron as they walked down the
corridor, heading to dinner. "What d'you reckon's the matter with him?"
There was a loud and impatient "tuh" from behind them. It was Hermione,
who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag,
which was so full of books it wouldn't close.
"And what are you tutting at us for?" said Ron irritably.
"Nothing," said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her
shoulder.
"Yes, you were," said Ron. "I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and
you --"
"Well, isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, with a look of maddening
superiority.
"If you don't want to tell us, don't," snapped Ron.
"Fine," said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.
"She doesn't know," said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. "She's
just trying to get us to talk to her again."
At eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for
the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived,
but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when
Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he
heaved onto Professor Binn's desk.
196
"What's that?" said Harry.
"Another boggart," said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. "I've been
combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this
one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll
get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he
sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my
office when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'll
like."
"Okay," said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at
all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a
real dementor.
"So..." Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. "The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm."
"How does it work?" said Harry nervously.
"Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus," said Lupin,
"which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield
between you and the dementor."
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, "The Patronus is
a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the
dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it
cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it.
But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for
you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it."
"What does a Patronus look like?" said Harry curiously.
"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it."
"And how do you conjure it?"
197
"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating,
with all your might, on a single, very happy memory."
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that
had happened to him at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, he
settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
"Right," he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his stomach.
"The incantation is this --" Lupin cleared his throat. "Expecto
patronum!"
"Expecto patronum, " Harry repeated under his breath, "expecto
patronum."
"Concentrating hard on your happy memory?"
"Oh -- yeah --" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that
first broom ride. "Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expecto
patronum, expecto patronum"
Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a
wisp of silvery gas.
"Did you see that?" said Harry excitedly. "Something happened!"
"Very good," said Lupin, smiling. "Right, then -- ready to try it on a
dementor?"
"Yes," Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the
middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying,
but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his
mother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again,
and he didn't want to... or did he?
Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.
A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward
Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around
198
the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box
and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling
breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him --
"Expecto patronum!" Harry yelled. "Expecto patronum! Expecto --"
But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.... Harry was failing
again through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder than
ever, echoing inside his head -- "Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'll
do anything!"
"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!"
"Harry!"
Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor.
The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn't have to ask what had
happened.
"Sorry," he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down
behind his glasses.
"Are you all right?" said Lupin.
"Yes..." Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against
it.
"Here --" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. "Eat this before we try
again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would
have been astounded if you had."
"It's getting worse," Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. "I
could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort
Lupin looked paler than usual. ,
"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --"
"I do!" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog
into his mouth. "I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match
199
against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this
game we've lost the Quidditch Cup!"
"All right then... " said Lupin. "You might want to select 'other
memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on.... That one doesn't
seem to have been strong enough...."
Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the
House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He
gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of
the classroom.
"Ready?" said Lupin, gripping the box lid.
"Ready," said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts
about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to
happen when the box opened.
"Go!" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark
once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting
hand was extending toward Harry -
"Expecto patronum!" Harry yelled. "Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --"
White fog obscured his senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around
him... then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --
"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --"
The sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a
cackle of high- pitched laughter --
"Harry! Harry... wake up...."
Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute
before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.
"I heard my dad," Harry mumbled. "That's the first time I've ever heard
him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run
for it...."
200
Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with
the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his
robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.
"You heard James?" said Lupin in a strange voice.
"Yeah..." Face dry, Harry looked up. "Why -- you didn't know my dad, did
you?"
"I -- I did, as a matter of fact," said Lupin. "We were friends at
Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight.
This charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln't have suggested
putting you through this...."
"No!" said Harry. He got up again. "I'll have one more go! I'm not
thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is.... Hang on...."
He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he could
turn into a good, strong Patronus...
The moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would be
leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, he
didn't know what was.... Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when
he'd realized he'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and
faced the packing case once more.
"Ready?" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his
better judgment. "Concentrating hard? All right -- go!"
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor
rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark
'EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Harry bellowed. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
"
The screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time,
it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer
and louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it
201
had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the
end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though
Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for how
much longer, he wasn't sure --
"Riddikulus!" roared Lupin, springing forward.
There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with
the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just
run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he
saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with
his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.
"Excellent!" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. "Excellent,
Harry! That was definitely a start!"
"Can we have another go? Just one more go?"
"Not now," said Lupin firmly. "You've had enough for one night. Here --"
He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate.
"Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next
week?"
"Okay," said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin
extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the
dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.
"Professor Lupin?" he said. "If you knew my dad, you must've known
Sirius Black as well."
Lupin turned very quickly.
"What gives you that idea?" he said sharply.
"Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too...."
Lupin's face relaxed.
202
"Yes, I knew him," he said shortly. "Or I thought I did. You'd better be
off, Harry, it's getting late."
Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a
corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its
plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned Black, as
Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughts
wandered back to his mother and father...
He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of
chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents' last moments
replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard
their voices since he was a very small child. But he'd never be able to
produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents
again....
"They're dead," he told himself sternly. "They're dead and listening to
echoes of them won't bring them back. You'd better get a grip on
yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup."
He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and
headed back to Gryffindor Tower.
Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin
won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for
Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He
therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. This
meant that with Lupin's anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were
more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a
week to do all his homework. Even so, he was showing the strain nearly
as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting
to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner
of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts,
rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file
upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped
when she was interrupted.
"How's she doing it?" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat
finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked
up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.
203
"Doing what?"
"Getting to all her classes!" Ron said. "I heard her talking to
Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going
on about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't 've been there, because
she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me
she's never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the
same time as Divination, and she's never missed one of them either!"
Harry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible
schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape's essay.
Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.
"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the
Firebolt. She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m' I'd got my
priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup
than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't care
if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first." Wood shook
his head in disbelief. "Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you'd
think I'd said something terrible... then I asked her how much longer
she was going to keep it. He screwed up his face and imitated Professor
McGonagall's severe voice. 'As long as necessary, Wood'... I reckon it's
time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There's an order form at the back
of Which Broomstick... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like
Malfoy's got."
"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good," said Harry flatly.
January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the
bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer
and nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. He was now
asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every
Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione
rushing past with her face averted.
"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet," Professor McGonagall told him
the twelfth time this happened, before he'd even opened his mouth.
"We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick
believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you
204
once we've finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me."
To make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not going
nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to
produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor
approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor
away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry
of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself,
guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents' voices again.
"You're expecting too much of yourself," said Professor Lupin, sternly
in their fourth week of practice. "For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even
an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing out
anymore, are you?"
I thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,"
said Harry dispiritedly. "Make them disappear --"
"The true Patronus does do that," said Lupin. "But you've achieved a
great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an
appearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them
at bay long enough to get back to the ground."
"You said it's harder if there are loads of them," said Harry.
"I have complete confidence in you," said Lupin, smiling. "Here --
you've earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won't
have tried it before --"
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
"Butterbeer!" said Harry, without thinking. "Yeah, I like that stuff!"
Lupin raised an eyebrow.
"Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade," Harry lied
quickly.
I see," said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. "Well --
let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm
205
supposed to take sides, as a teacher... " he added hastily
They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he'd
been wondering for a while.
"What's under a dementor's hood?"
Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.
"Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to
tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and
worst weapon."
"What's that?"
"They call it the Dementor's Kiss," said Lupin, with a slightly twisted
smile. "It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I
suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp
their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul."
Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.
"What -- they kill --?"
"Oh no," said Lupin. "Much worse than that. You can exist without your
soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But
you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. .. anything.
There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty
shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost."
Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, "It's the fate that
awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The
Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find
him."
Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul
sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.
"He deserves it," he said suddenly.
206
"You think so?" said Lupin lightly. "Do you really think anyone deserves
that?"
"Yes," said Harry defiantly. "For... for some things..."
He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he'd
overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying
his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he'd
gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn't be very
impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and
left the History of Magic classroom.
Harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood,
the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant
thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you
that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
"Do watch where you're going, Potter!"
"Sorry, Professor --"
"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well,
here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't
seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend
somewhere, Potter...."
Harry's jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
"I can have it back?" Harry said weakly. "Seriously?"
"Seriously," said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. "I
daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't
you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the
running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind
enough to remind me only last night...."
Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor
Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning
from ear to ear.
207
"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it?
Tomorrow?"
"Yeah... anything," said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a
month. "You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... She was
only trying to help...."
"Yeah, all right," said Ron. "She's in the common room how working, for
a change --"
They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville
Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him
entrance.
"I wrote them down!" Neville was saying tearfully. "But I must've
dropped them somewhere!"
"A likely tale!" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: "Good
even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying
to force entry to the chambers within!"
"Oh, shut up," said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.
"I've lost the passwords!" Neville told them miserably. "I made him tell
me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps
changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!"
"Oddsbodikins," said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely
disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common
room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the
next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his
Firebolt.
"Where'd you get it, Harry?"
"Will you let me have a go?" "Have you ridden it yet, Harry?"
"Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens!"
208
"Can I just hold it, Harry?"
After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and
admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a
clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them,
bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron
approached her table and at last, she looked up.
"I got it back," said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the
Firebolt.
"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!" said Ron.
"Well -- there might have been!" said Hermione. "I mean, at least you
know now that it's safe!"
"Yeah, I suppose so," said Harry. "Id better put it upstairs."
"I'll take it!" said Ron eagerly. "I've got to give Scabbers his rat
tonic."
He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass,
carried it away up the boys' staircase.
"Can I sit down, then?" Harry asked Hermione.
"I suppose so," said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a
chair.
Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay
on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies
essay ("Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity" and at the rune
translation Hermione was now poring over.
"How are you getting through all this stuff?" Harry asked her.
"Oh, well -- you know -- working hard," said Hermione. Close-up, Harry
saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.
"Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?" Harry asked, watching
209
her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.
"I couldn't do that!" said Hermione, looking scandalized.
"Arithmancy looks terrible," said Harry, picking up a very
complicated-looking number chart.
"Oh no, it's wonderful!" said Hermione earnestly. "It's my favorite
subject! It's --"
But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out.
At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys'
staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the
entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and
then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.
"LOOK!" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table.
"LOOK!" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.
"Ron, what --?"
"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!"
Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry
looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it.
Something that looked horribly like --
"BLOOD!" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. "HE'S GONE! AND YOU
KNOW
WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?"
"N -- no," said Hermione in a trembling voice.
Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation. Hermione and
Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were
several long, ginger cat hairs.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
210
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW
It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship. Each was so
angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.
Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to
eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on
him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by
suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds.
Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that
Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been
there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat
ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical
Menagerie.
Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when
he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that
way, she lost her temper with Harry too.
"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!" she said shrilly. "First the
Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me
alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!"
Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.
"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was," said
Fred bracingly. "And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away.
It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he
probably didn't feel a thing."
"Fred!" said Ginny indignantly.
"All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself," said George.
"He bit Goyle for us once!" Ron said miserably. "Remember, Harry?"
"Yeah, that's true," said Harry.
"His finest hour," said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. "Let the
scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh,
211
come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what's
the point of moaning?"
In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come
along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw
match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd
finished. This did seem to take Ron's mind off Scabbers for a moment
("Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?") so they set off for
the Quidditch field together.
Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an
eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else
had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the
benefit of her professional opinion.
"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a
slight list to the tail end -- you often find they develop a drag after
a few years. They've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the
Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows -- a Pity they've
stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom
it was too...."
She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, "Er -- Madam
Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to
practice...."
"Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter," said Madam Hooch. "I'll sit
over here with Weasley...."
She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor
team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow's
match.
"Harry, I've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It's Cho
Chang. She's a fourth year, and she's pretty good.... I really hoped she
wouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries...." Wood scowled
his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, "On
the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like
a joke next to the Firebolt." He gave Harry's broom a look of fervent
admiration, then said, "Okay, everyone, let's go -- "
212
And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the
ground.
It was better than he'd ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the
lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it
sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a
green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet
screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the
grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into
the air again.
"Harry, I'm letting the Snitch out!" Wood called.
Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped
it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten
seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a
minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the
others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell's knee, looped her easily,
and caught it again.
It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the
Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by
the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn't have a single criticism
to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.
"I can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow!" said Wood. "Not unless
-- Harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you?"
"Yeah," said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were
stronger.
"The dementors won't turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore'd go ballistic,"
said Fred confidently.
"Well, let's hope not," said Wood. "Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let's
get back to the tower... turn in early --"
213
"I'm staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt," Harry told
Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms,
Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came
to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.
"Here you go," said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.
Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed
off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of
the field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with
a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that
they go back to the castle.
Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy
stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its
phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway
toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that
made his heart turn over -- a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the
darkness.
Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.
"What's the matter?" said Ron.
Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, "Lumos!"
A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and
illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was
Crookshanks.
"Get out of here!" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone
lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks
had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.
"See?" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. "She's still
letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down
Scabbers with a couple of birds now...."
Harry didn't say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped
through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged
214
to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of
his moment of panic, Harry didn't say anything to Ron -- nor did he look
left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys
in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a
sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in
the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited
muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin
team were all looking thunderstruck.
"Did you see his face?" said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. "He
can't believe it! This is brilliant!"
Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.
"Put it here, Harry," he said, laying the broom in the middle of the
table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People
from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.
Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a
superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend,
Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.
"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!" said Percy heartily as she examined the
Firebolt closely. "Penelope and I have got a bet on," he told the team.
"Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!"
Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to
her table.
"Harry -- make sure you win," said Percy, in an urgent whisper. "I
haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!" And-he bustled off to
join her in a piece of toast.
"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?" said a cold, drawling voice.
Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right
behind him.
"Yeah, reckon so," said Harry casually.
215
"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?" said Malfoy, eyes
glittering maliciously. "Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in
case you get too near a dementor."
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy," said Harry. "Then
it could catch the Snitch for you."
The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he
stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team,
who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's
broom really was a Firebolt.
At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker
rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match
against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze;
there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though
nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match
could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the
stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand
from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear
under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. He
wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.
"You know what we've got to do," said Wood as they prepared to leave the
locker rooms. "If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just --
just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!"
They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw
team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field.
Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was
shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing,
nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as
the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight
lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to
do with nerves.
"Wood, Davies, shake hands," Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook
216
hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.
"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --"
Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster
than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting
around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which
was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.
"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that
Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick,
the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at
this year's World Championship --"
"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?"
interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice.
"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information
-- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --"
"Jordan!"
"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading
for goal..."
Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a
glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She
was undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him,
forcing him to change direction.
"Show her your acceleration, Harry!" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in
pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.
Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal
posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first
goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw
it -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the
barriers.
Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was
217
speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was
ten feet away --
Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of
nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those
few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.
There was a great "Ooooooh" of disappointment from the Gryffindor
supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end.
George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger
directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in
midair to avoid it.
"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt
go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn --
Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance
is really noticeable in these long --"
"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON
WITH THE
COMMENTARY!"
Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put
Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him,
Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw
Chaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of
tiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --
Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just
then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --
"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!" Wood roared as Harry
swerved
to avoid a collision. "KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!"
Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had
vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty
feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following
him.... She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch
herself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to
218
take the consequences....
He dived again, and Cho, thinking he'd seen the Snitch, tried to follow;
Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose
fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the
Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.
He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on
the Snitch with every second -- then --
"Oh!" screamed Cho, pointing.
Distracted, Harry looked down.
Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at
him.
He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he
whipped out his wand and roared, "Expecto patronum!"
Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his
wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to
watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he was
nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just
managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.
Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six
scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was
hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he
could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.
"That's my boy!" Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all
kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his
head would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its
way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a
gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the
lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.
"Yes!" Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. "Yes! Yes!"
219
"Well done, Harry!" said Percy, looking delighted. "Ten Galleons to me!
Must find Penelope, excuse me --"
"Good for you, Harry!" roared Seamus Finnigan.
"Ruddy brilliant!" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling
Gryffindors.
"That was quite some Patronus," said a voice in Harry's ear.
Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and
pleased.
"The dementors didn't affect me at all!" Harry said excitedly. "I didn't
feel a thing!"
"That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors," said Professor
Lupin. "Come and see -- "
He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of
the field.
"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright," said Lupin.
Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy,
Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all
struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It
looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standing
over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was
Professor McGonagall.
"An unworthy trick!" she was shouting. "A low and cowardly attempt to
sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty
points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about
this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!"
If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was
this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry's side, doubled up
with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from
the robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it.
220
"Come on, Harry!" said George, fighting his way over. "Party! Gryffindor
common room, now!"
"Right," said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the
rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the
stadium and back up to the castle.
It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went
on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared
for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of
butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.
"How did you do that?" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started
throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.
"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs," Fred
muttered in Harry's ear.
Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly,
was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled
Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from
the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles
and went over to her.
"Did you even come to the match?" he asked her.
"Of course I did," said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not
looking up. "And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well,
but I need to read this by Monday."
"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food," Harry said, looking over
at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the
hatchet.
"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to
read!" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. "Anyway..." She
glanced over at Ron too. "He doesn't want me to join in."
There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly,
221
"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those
Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --"
Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she
tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward
the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.
"Can't you give her a break?" Harry asked Ron quietly.
"No," said Ron flatly. "If she just acted like she was sorry -- but
she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like
Scabbers has gone on vacation or something."
The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in
her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist
that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their
dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed
into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a
ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting
off to sleep....
He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his
Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was
winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch
glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped
up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run,
and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out,
and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a
clearing and -
"AAARRGGHH! NOOO!"
Harry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face. Disoriented
in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear
movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side of
the room: "What's going on?"
Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the
divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment,
Dean Thomas lit his lamp.
222
Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of
utmost terror on his face.
"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!"
"What?"
"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!"
"You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?" said Dean.
"Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!"
They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first,
and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and
sleepy voices called after them.
"Who shouted?"
"What're you doing?"
The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered
with the debris from the party. It was deserted.
"Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?"
"I'm telling you, I saw him!"
"What's all the noise?"
"Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!"
A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing
gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.
"Excellent, are we carrying on?" said Fred Weasley brightly.
"Everyone back upstairs!" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and
pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.
223
"Perce -- Sirius Black!" said Ron faintly. "In our dormitory! With a
knife! Woke me up!"
The common room went very still.
"Nonsense!" said Percy, looking startled. "You had too much to eat, Ron
-- had a nightmare --"
"I'm telling you --"
"Now, really, enough's enough!"
Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as
she entered the common room and stared furiously around.
"I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting
ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!"
"I certainly didn't authorize this, Professor!" said Percy, puffing
himself up indignantly. "I was just telling them all to get back to bed!
My brother Ron here had a nightmare --"
"IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE!" Ron yelled. "PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND
SIRIUS
BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!"
Professor McGonagall stared at him.
"Don't be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through
the portrait hole?"
"Ask him!" said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir
Cadogan's picture. "Ask him if he saw --"
Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait
back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated
breath. "Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?"
"Certainly, good lady!" cried Sir Cadogan.
224
There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.
"You -- you did?" said Professor McGonagall. "But -- but the password!"
"He had 'em!" said Sir Cadogan proudly. "Had the whole week's, my lady!
Read 'em off a little piece of paper!"
Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to
face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.
"Which person," she said, her voice shaking, "which abysmally foolish
person wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying around?"
There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks.
Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised
his hand slowly into the air.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
SNAPE'S GRUDGE
No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle
was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common
room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor
McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.
Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter
security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to
recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling
up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in
the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had
been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat
Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely
nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she
was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been
hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking
in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.
Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on
the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred
225
and George had been right in thinking that they -- and now Harry, Ron,
and Hermione -- were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway
within it.
"D'you reckon we should tell someone?" Harry asked Ron.
"We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's," said Ron dismissively.
"We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into."
Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up
too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.
Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life,
people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear
that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely
shaken by the night's events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what
had happened, with a wealth of detail.
"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was
in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft... I woke up and
one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down.... I rolled
over... and I saw him standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads of
filthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must've been twelve
inches... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled,
and he scampered.
"Why, though?" Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who
had been listening to his chilling tale departed. "Why did he run?"
Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the
wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved
twelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people, and this
time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.
"He must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle once
you'd yelled and woken people up," said Harry thoughtfully. "He'd've had
to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then he
would' ve met the teachers...."
Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with
226
him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a
detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower.
Poor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night for
somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at
him. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one
his grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black's break-in,
she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive
over breakfast -- a Howler.
The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual,
and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet
envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite
him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one from
his mother the year before.
"Run for it, Neville," Ron advised.
Neville didn't need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding
it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin
table exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler
go off in the entrance hall -- Neville's grandmother's voice, magically
magnified to a hundred times its Usual volume, shrieking about how he
had brought shame on the whole family.
Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that
he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on
the wrist.
"Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig."
Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of
Neville's cornflakes. The note inside said:
Dear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon 'round
six? I'll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE
HALL; YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Hagrid
"He probably wants to hear all about Black!" said Ron.
So at six o'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower,
227
passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance
hall.
Hagrid was already waiting for them.
"All right, Hagrid!" said Ron. "S'pose you want to hear about Saturday
night, do you?"
"I've already heard all abou' it," said Hagrid, opening the front doors
and leading them outside.
"Oh," said Ron, looking slightly put out.
The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid's cabin was Buckbeak, who
was stretched out on top of Hagrid's patchwork quilt, his enormous wings
folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.
Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic,
hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from
the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door.
"What are they for, Hagrid?" said Harry.
"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous
Creatures," said Hagrid. "This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down ter
London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus...."
Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that
Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's
face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping
him prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven
it clean out of their minds.
Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they
knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with
Hagrid's cooking.
I got somethin' ter discuss with you two," said Hagrid, sitting himself
between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.
"What?" said Harry.
228
"Hermione," said Hagrid.
"What about her?" said Ron.
"She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me
a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to
her because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat
--"
"-- ate Scabbers!" Ron interjected angrily.
"Because her cat acted like all cats do," Hagrid continued doggedly.
"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at
the moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work
she's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case,
mind.... She's found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he'll stand
a good chance now..."
"Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --" Harry began awkwardly.
"I'm not blamin' yeh!" said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. "Gawd
knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin'
Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I
thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. Tha's
all."
Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.
"Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She's got
her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to
her --"
"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again!" Ron said
angrily. "But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she
won't hear a word against it!"
"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets," said Hagrid
wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid's
pillow.
229
They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved
chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them back
up to the castle.
A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they
returned to the common room.
"Hogsmeade, next weekend!" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the
new notice. "What d'you reckon?" he added quietly to Harry as they went
to sit down.
"Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes...."
Harry said, even more quietly.
"Harry!" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around
at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing
a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.
"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall
about that map!" said Hermione.
"Can you hear someone talking, Harry?" growled Ron, not looking at
Hermione.
"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly
did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --"
"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!" said Ron furiously.
"Haven't you done enough damage this year?"
Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks
leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression
on Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the
girls' dormitories.
"So how about it?" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no
interruption. "Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You
haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!"
230
Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
"Okay," he said. "But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time."
On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag,
slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast
with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the
table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him
walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody
else proceeded to the front doors.
"'Bye!" Harry called to Ron. "See you when you get back!"
Ron grinned and winked.
Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of
his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed
it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it.
The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.
Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, "Dissendium!" and shoved
his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville
came around the corner.
"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!"
"Hi, Neville," said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and
pushing the map back into his pocket. "What are you up to?"
"Nothing," shrugged Neville. "Want a game of Exploding Snap?"
"Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire
essay for Lupin --"
"I'll come with you!" said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either!"
"Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!"
"Great, you can help me!" said Neville, his round face anxious. "I don't
understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it,
231
or --"
He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder.
It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.
"And what are you two doing here?" said Snape, coming to a halt and
looking from one to the other. "An odd place to meet --"
To Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways
on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.
"We're not -- meeting here," said Harry. "We just -- met here."
"Indeed?" said Snape. "You have a habit of turning up in unexpected
places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... I
suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong."
Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the
corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over the
one-eyed witch's head, examining it closely.
Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the
password, then pretending he'd left his vampire essay in the library and
doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out
the map again and held it close to his nose.
The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map
carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled
Severus Snape was now back in its office.
He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself
inside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute.
He wiped the Marauder's Map blank again, then set off at a run.
Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into
the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.
It's me," he muttered.
232
"What kept you?" Ron hissed.
"Snape was hanging around."
They set off up the High Street.
"Where are you?" Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. "Are
you still there? This feels weird...."
They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of
an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The
owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them;
from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls ("Local Deliveries
Only"), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry's
hand.
Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had
to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There
were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred's and George's wildest
dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from
under the cloak. They left Zonko's with their money bags considerably
lighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with
Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup
apiece.
The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying
indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope
to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It
stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight
was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.
"Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it," said Ron as they leaned on the
fence, looking up at it. "I asked Nearly Headless Nick... he says he's
heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George
tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut...."
Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the
cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was
climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments
later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy
233
was speaking.
"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the
hearing to tell them about my arm... about how I couldn't use it for
three months...."
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
"I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend
himself... 'There's no 'arm in 'im, 'onest that hippogriff's as good as
dead --"
Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent
grin.
"What are you doing, Weasley?"
Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.
"Suppose You'd love to live here, wouldn't you, Weasley? Dreaming about
having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- is
that true?"
Harry seized the back of Ron's robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.
"Leave him to me," he hissed in Ron's ear.
The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around
behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful
of mud out of the path.
"We were just discussing your friend Hagrid," Malfoy said to Ron. "Just
trying to imagine what he's saying to the Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures. D'you think he'll cry when they cut off his
hippogriff's
SPLAT.
Malfoy's head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair
was suddenly dripping in muck.
234
"What the --?"
Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing
so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring
wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.
"What was that? 'Who did that?"
"Very haunted up here, isn't it?" said Ron, with the air of one
commenting on the weather.
Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use
against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted
landscape.
Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded
some foul-smelling, green sludge.
SPLATTER.
Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the
spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes.
"It came from over there!" said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at
a spot some six feet to the left of Harry.
Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie.
Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe's
back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of
pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the
only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry
stuck out his leg. Crabbe stumbled -- and his huge, flat foot caught the
hem of Harry's cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off
his face.
For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.
"AAARGH!" he yelled, pointing at Harry's head. Then he turned tail and
ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind
him.
235
Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.
"Harry!" Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point
where Harry had disappeared, "you'd better run for it! If Malfoy tells
anyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --" "See you
later," said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path
toward Hogsmeade.
Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe
Malfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak -- nobody except
Dumbledore. Harry's stomach turned over -- Dumbledore would know exactly
what had happened, if Malfoy said any- thing --
Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone
floor, through the trapdoor -- Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it
under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.... Malfoy would get
back first... how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a
sharp pain in his side, Harry didn't slow down until he reached the
stone slide. He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too
much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher -- he hid it
in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty
hands slipping on the sides of the chute. He reached the inside of the
witch's hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and
hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from
behind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.
It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes
swishing, then stopped in front of him.
"So," he said.
There was a look of surpressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look
innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he
quickly hid in his pockets.
"Come with me, Potter," said Snape.
Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the
236
inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs
to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.
Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious
trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in
jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting
in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.
"Sit," said Snape.
Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.
"Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter," said
Snape.
Harry didn't say anything.
"He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into
Weasley -- apparently alone."
Still, Harry didn't speak.
"Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large
amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that
could have happened?"
Harry tried to look mildly surprised.
"I don't know, Professor."
Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to
stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.
"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what
it might have been, Potter?"
"No," said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.
"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair."
237
There was a long silence.
"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey," said Harry. "If he's seeing
things like --"
"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?" said Snape
softly. "Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has
permission to be in Hogsmeade."
"I know that," said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or
fear. "It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --"
"Malfoy is not having hallucinations," snarled Snape, and he bent down,
a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot
apart. "If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you."
"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower," said Harry. "Like you told --" "Can
anyone confirm that?"
Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible
smile.
"So," he said, straightening up again. "Everyone from the Minister of
Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from
Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the
ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where
he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.
Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the
truth. He wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.
"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter," Snape said
suddenly, his eyes glinting. "He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small
amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut
above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends
and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny."
"My dad didn't strut," said Harry, before he could stop himself. "And
neither do I."
238
"Your father didn't set much store by rules either," Snape went on,
pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. "Rules were for
lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --"
"SHUT UP!"
Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his
last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn't care that
Snape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.
"What did you say to me, Potter?"
"I told you to shut up about my dad!" Harry yelled. I know the truth,
all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for my dad!"
Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.
"And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father
saved my life?" he whispered. "Or did he consider the details too
unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?"
Harry bit his lip. He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to
admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.
I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father,
Potter," he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. "Have you been
imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your
saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that
would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at
the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was
saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would
have been expelled from Hogwarts."
Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.
"Turn out your pockets, Potter!" he spat suddenly.
Harry didn't move. There was a pounding in his ears.
239
"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them
out, Potter!"
Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and
the Marauder's Map.
Snap picked up the Zonko's bag.
"Ron gave them to me," said Harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron
off before Snape saw him. "He -brought them back from Hogsmeade last
time --"
"Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very
touching... and what is this?"
Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his
face impassive.
"Spare bit of parchment," he said with a shrug.
Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.
"Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?" he said.
"Why don't I just -- throw this away?"
His hand moved toward the fire.
"No!" Harry said quickly.
"So!" said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. "Is this another
treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter,
perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into
Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?"
Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.
"Let me see, let me see...." he muttered, taking out his wand and
smoothing the map out on his desk. "Reveal your secret!" he said,
touching the wand to the parchment.
240
Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.
"Show yourself!" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.
It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.
"Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield
the information you conceal!" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.
As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the
smooth surface of the map.
Mooney presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep
his abnormally large nose out of other people's business."
Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map
didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.
"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor
Snape is an ugle git."
It would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious.
And there was more....
"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like
that ever became a professor."
Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he'd opened them, the map had had
its last word.
"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his
hair , the slimeball."
Harry waited for the blow to fall.
"So..." said Snape softly. "We'll see about this...."
He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from
a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.
241
"Lupin!" Snape called into the fire. "I want a word!"
Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared
in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was
clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.
"You called, Severus?" said Lupin mildly.
"I certainly did," said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode
back to his desk. "I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was
carrying this."
Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony,
Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed
expression appeared on Lupin's face.
"Well?" said Snape.
Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin
was doing some very quick thinking.
"Well?" said Snape again. "This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic.
This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you
imagine Potter got such a thing?"
Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction,
warned him not to interrupt.
"Full of Dark Magic?" he repeated mildly. "Do you really think so,
Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that
insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I
imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --"
"Indeed?" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. "You think a
joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it more
likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?"
Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently,
did Lupin.
242
"You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?" he said. "Harry, do
you know any of these men?"
"No," said Harry quickly.
"You see, Severus?" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. "It looks like a
Zonko product to me --"
Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out
of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitch
in his chest and trying to speak.
"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff," he choked. "Bought -- it... in
Zonko's... ages -- ago..."
"Well!" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around
cheerfully. "That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back,
shall I?" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. "Harry, Ron,
come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus
--"
Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and
Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking.
Then Harry turned to Lupin.
"Professor, I --"
"I don't want to hear explanations," said Lupin shortly. He glanced
around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. "I happen to know
that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know
it' s a map," he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. "I don't want to
know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you
didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a
student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let
you have it back, Harry."
Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.
"Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?"
243
"Because...," Lupin hesitated, "because these mapmakers would have
wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely
entertaining."
"Do you know them?" said Harry, impressed.
"We've met," he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously
than ever before.
"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you
take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have
heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect
on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor
way to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic
tricks."
He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any
point in Snape's office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble
staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the
Invisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn't dare go and
get it.
"It's my fault," said Ron abruptly. "I persuaded you to go. Lupin's
right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --"
He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were
pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her face
convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heart
plummeted -- had she told Professor McGonagall?
"Come to have a good gloat?" said Ron savagely as she stopped in front
of them. "Or have you just been to tell on us?"
"No," said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip
was trembling. "I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his
case. Buckbeak is going to be executed."
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL
244
He sent me this," Hermione said, holding out the letter.
Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had
smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.
Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.
Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget all
the help you gave us.
Hagrid
"They can't do this," said Harry. "They can't. Buckbeak isn't
dangerous."
"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it," said Hermione, wiping
her eyes. "You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old
fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always
is. Only I can't see any hope.... Nothing will have changed."
"Yeah, it will," said Ron fiercely. "You won't have to do all the work
alone this time, Hermione. I'll help."
"Oh, Ron!"
Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely.
Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of
the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.
"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers..." she sobbed.
"Oh -- well -- he was old," said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that
she had let go of him. "And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum
and Dad might get me an owl now."
The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second
break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit
Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during
Care of Magical Creatures lessons.
245
He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.
"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in
black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates
yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said
his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em...."
"There's still the appeal!" said Ron fiercely. "Don't give up Yet, we're
working on it!"
They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class.
Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and
kept looking back, laughing derisively.
"S'no good, Ron," said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps.
"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure
the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him
that...."
Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried
in his handkerchief.
"Look at him blubber!"
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle
doors, listening.
"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?" said Malfoy. "And he's
supposed to be our teacher!"
Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got
there first -- SMACK!
She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could
muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood
flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.
"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --"
"Hermione!" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung
246
it back.
"Get off, Ron!"
Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle
looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.
"C'mon," Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had
disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.
"Hermione!" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed.
"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!" Hermione said
shrilly. "You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin
wins!"
"We're due in Charms," said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. "We'd
better go."
They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's
classroom.
"You're late, boys!" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened
the classroom door. "Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting
with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs --"
Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron
looked behind him.
"Where's Hermione gone?"
Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet
Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.
"That's weird," said Harry, staring at Ron. "Maybe -- maybe she went to
the bathroom or something?"
But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson.
"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too," said Ron as the
247
class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had
left them with a feeling of great contentment.
Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their
apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off,
and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.
"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?" Ron said anxiously as
they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.
They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password
("Flibbertigibbet"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the
common room.
Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an
open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry
prodded her awake.
"Wh -- what?" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly
around. "Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?"
"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes," said Harry.
"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?"
"What? Oh no!" Hermione squeaked. "I forgot to go to Charms!"
"But how could you forget?" said Harry. "You were with us till we were
right outside the classroom!"
"I don't believe it!" Hermione wailed. "Was Professor Flitwick angry?
Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!"
"You know what, Hermione?" said Ron, looking down at the enormous
Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. "I reckon you're
cracking up. You're trying to do too much."
"No, I'm not!" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and
staring hopelessly around for her bag. "I just made a mistake, that's
all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll see
you in Divination!"
248
Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys
classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.
"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our
exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!"
Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room.
Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white
mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety
table.
"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term," Ron
muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she
was lurking nearby.
"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry," Harry muttered
back. "I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my
hands."
"Good day to you!" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor
Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati
and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow
of their crystal ball.
"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I
had planned," said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the
fire and gazing around. "The fates have informed me that your
examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you
sufficient practice."
Hermione snorted.
"Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She
does! What an amazing prediction!" she said, not troubling to keep her
voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.
It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her
face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had
not.
249
"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art," she said dreamily. "I do
not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite
depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and
external eyes" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff
his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise -- "so as to clear the Inner
Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will
see before the end of the class."
And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring
blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts
such as "this is stupid" kept drifting across it. It didn't help that
Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.
"Seen anything yet?" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet
crystal gazing.
"Yeah, there's a burn on this table," said Ron, pointing. "Someone's
spilled their candle."
"This is such a waste of time," Hermione hissed. "I could be practicing
something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms --"
Professor Trelawney rustled past.
"Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within
their Orb?" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles.
I don't need help," Ron whispered. "It's obvious what this means.
There's going to be loads of fog tonight."
Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.
"Now, really!" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in
their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. "You are
disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!" She approached their table and
peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was
sure he knew what was coming --
"There is something here!" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowerng her
250
face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses.
"Something moving... but what is it?"
Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, Including his Firebolt,
that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough --
"My dear Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. "It is here,
plainer than ever before... my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever
closer... the Gr --"
"Oh, for goodness' sake!" said Hermione loudly. "Not that ridiculous
Grim again!"
Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati
whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.
Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable
anger.
"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class
my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of
Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student
whose mind was so hopelessly mundane."
There was a moment's silence. Then --
"Fine!" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the
Future back into her bag. "Fine!" she repeated, swinging the bag over
her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. "I give up! I'm
leaving!"
And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the
trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight.
It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor
Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned
abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as she
tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.
"Ooooo!" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. "Ooooo,
Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't
251
you? Didn't you, Professor? 'Around Easter, one of our number will leave
us forever!' You said it ages ago, Professor!"
Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.
"Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us.
One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs.... The Inner
Eye can be a burden, you know..."
Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that
Professor Trelawney could join their table instead.
"Some day Hermione's having, eh?" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.
"Yeah..."
Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white
mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The
last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch
final drawing ever nearer.
The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never
had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous
collapse, and he wasn't the only one.
"Call this a holiday!" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one
afternoon. "The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?"
But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she
was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to
leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next
morning; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes, and seemed
constantly close to tears.
Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he wasn't
doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with
names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A
Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be
horrible to Crookshanks.
252
Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice
every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The
Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after
the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two
hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that
they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It
also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because
capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.
"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up," Wood
told Harry constantly. "Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry,
or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, Haven't you? You
must catch the Snitch only if we're --"
"I KNOW, OLIVER!" Harry yelled.
The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match.
Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie
Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been seeker. But Harry doubted
whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The
enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy
was still smarting ,bout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was
even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of
punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in
the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made
him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.
Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly
charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between
the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of
small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty
incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year
ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.
Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to
class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him
up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching
away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood
had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he
went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole
253
of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it
was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was
surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his
Firebolt's safety than his own. When he wasn't flying it, he locked it
securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower
at break times to check that it was still there.
All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the
night before the match. Even Hermione had Put down her books.
"I can't work, I can't concentrate," she said nervously.
There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing
with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver
Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner,
prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes.
Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of
things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he
did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was
fighting to get out of his stomach.
"You're going to be fine," Hermione told him, though she looked
positively terrified.
"You've got a Firebolt!" said Ron.
"Yeah..." said Harry, his stomach writhing.
It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, "Team! Bed!"
Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood
was yelling, "Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!" Then he
dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the
match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid
a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he had
forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start.
It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken
place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team
254
definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very
thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to
pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window.
The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the
treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and
innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would
be perfect.
Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when
something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the
silvery lawn.
Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them
on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim -- not now
-- not right before the match -
He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic
searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now... It
wasn't the Grim at all ... it was a cat.... Harry clutched the window
ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only
Crookshanks....
Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat
against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was
sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.
And just then, it emerged -- a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving
stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry
stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well,
how could it be an omen of Harry's death?
"Ron!" Harry hissed. "Ron! Wake up!"
"Huh?"
I need you to tell me if you can see something!"
"S'all dark, Harry," Ron muttered thickly. "What're you or, about?"
255
"Down here --"
Harry looked quickly back out of the window.
Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill
to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't
there. Where had they gone?
A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.
Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the
next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as
he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding
them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry
noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.
Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching
nothing himself Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else
had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left
the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.
"Good luck, Harry!" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing.
"Okay -- no wind to speak of -- sun's a bit bright, that could impair
your vision, watch out for it -- ground's fairly hard, good, that'll
give us a fast kickoff --"
Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally,
they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest
of the school spilling onto the lawn.
"Locker rooms," said Wood tersely.
None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry
wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he'd eaten
something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time
at all, Wood was saying, "Okay, it's time, let's go --"
They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Threequarters
of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the
256
Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like "GO
GRYFFINDOR!" and "LIONS FOR THE CUK' Behind the Slytherin goal posts,
however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of
Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very
front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.
"And here are the Gryffindors!" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as
commentator as usual. "Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley,
and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a
good few years --"
Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of "boos" from the Slytherin end.
"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's Made some
changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill
--"
More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a
point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team; the
rest of them were enormous.
"Captains, shake hands!" said Madam Hooch.
Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very
tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's
fingers.
"Mount your brooms!" said Madam Hooch. "Three... two... one..."
The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen
brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead;
his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw
Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.
"And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with
the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking
good, Alicia! Argh, no -- Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington
of Slytherin tearing UP the field -- WHAM! -- nice Bludger work there by
George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by -- Johnson,
Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina -- nice swerve around
257
Montague -- duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger!- SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO
GRYFFINDOR!"
Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the
sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight
"OUCH!"
Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing
into her.
"Sorry!" said Flint as the crowd below booed. "Sorry, didn't see her!"
A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of
Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and
began to bleed.
"That will do!" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. "Penalty
shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty
shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!"
"Come off it, Miss!" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and
Alicia flew forward to take the penalty.
"Come on, Alicia!" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the
crowd. "YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO
GRYFFINDOR!"
Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely,
fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of
the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.
"'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint
waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. "Superb! Very difficult to pass --
very difficult indeed -- YES! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!"
Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still
making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential
that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty
points up --
258
"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession -- no!
Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for
Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field -- THAT WAS
DELIBERATE!"
Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead
of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cart wheeled in the
air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.
Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and
began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty
past the Slytherin Seeker.
"THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING --"
"Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way --"
"I'm telling it like it is, Professor!"
Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch it was
shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts -- but he
mustn't catch it yet -- and if Malfoy saw it -
Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around
and sped off toward the Slytherin end -- it worked. Malfoy went haring
after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there....
WHOOSH.
One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the
gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again
WHOOSH.
The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was
closing in.
Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him,
259
clubs raised --
He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick
collided with a sickening crunch.
"Ha haaa!" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from
each other, clutching their heads. "Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up
earlier than that to beat a Firebold And it's Gryffindor in possession
again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle -- Flint alongside her -- poke him
in the eye, Angelina! -- it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke -- oh
no -- Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal
posts, come on now, Wood, save --!"
But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin
end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the
magical megaphone away from him.
"Sorry, Professor, sorry! WoiA happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead,
thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession --"
it was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged
that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were
rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with
his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley
elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams
penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the
score forty-ten to Gryffindor.
The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to
Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it once Gryffindor
was fifty points ahead -
Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around
her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of
revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence
to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after
the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom,
completely winded.
Madam Hooch was beside herself
260
"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN
THE SCORING
AREA!" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. "Gryffindor penalty!"
And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a
Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle Out of his hands; Alicia
seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal -- seventy-ten.
The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse -- Gryffindor was
sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup
was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he
soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy
speeding along behind him.
And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.
Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he
stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down --
Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed
hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back.
"You --"
Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach -- Malfoy was
panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were
sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he'd wanted to do -- the
Snitch had disappeared again.
"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics." Madam
Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his
Nimbus Two Thousand and One.
"YOU CHEATING SCUM!" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone,
dancing
out of Professor McGonagall's reach. "YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B --"
Pprofessor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off She was
actually shaking her finger in Malfoys direction, her hat had fallen
261
off, and she too was shouting furiously.
Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed by
several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the
Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred on
to greater heights.
"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal -- Montague scores
--" Lee groaned. "Seventy- twenty to Gryffindor..."
Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each
other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch....
"Get out of it, Potter!" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to
turn and found Harry blocking him.
"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina,
COME ON!"
Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was
streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper
-- they were all going to block her --
Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along
the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the
Slytherins.
"AAAAAAARRRGH!"
They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's Way was
clear.
"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty!"
Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt
in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.
And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was
diving, a look of triumph on his face -- there, a few feet above the
grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer -
262
Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead -
"Go! Go! Go!" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfay -- Harry
flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him --
he was at Malfoy's ankles -- he was level --
Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked
Malfoy's arm out of the way and --
"YES!"
He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium
exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The
tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings
hopelessly against his fingers.
Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized
Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry
felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's,
Alicia's, and Katie's voices, "We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!"
Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling
hoarsely, back to earth.
Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto
the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused
impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest
of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into
the light, he saw Hagrid, Plastered with crimson rosettes -- "Yeh beat
'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em!
Wait till I tell Buckbeak!" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a
maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder
even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and
there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words
failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands,
where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.
If only there had been a dementor around.... As a sobbing Wood passed
Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have
263
produced the world's best Patronus.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY'S PREDICTION
Harry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a
week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the
days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was
strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several
pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones
or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of
the lake.
But they couldn't. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing
around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle,
trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of
summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley
had been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s
(Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his
N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest
qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of
Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave
very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common
room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious
than Percy was Hermione.
Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend
several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when they
saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column
read:
Monday
9 o'clock, Arithmancy
9 o'clock, Transfiguration
Lunch
264
1 o'clock, Charms
1 o'clock, Ancient Runes
"Hermione?" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when
interrupted these days. "Er -- are you sure you've copied down these
times right?"
"What?" snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it.
"Yes, of course I have."
"Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at
once?" said Harry.
"No," said Hermione shortly. "Have either of you seen my copy of
Numerology and Gramatica?"
"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading," said Ron, but
very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron,
and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.
"Beaky's gettin' a bit depressed," Hagrid told them, bending low on the
pretense of checking that Harry's flobberworm was still alive. "Bin
cooped up too long. But still... we'll know day after tomorrow -- one
way or the other --"
They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try
as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and
Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled
something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before
moving away.
Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of
Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean
Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he
could have had one of Fortescue's choco-nut sundaes with him in the
stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the
greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once
more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day,
when it would all be over.
265
Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the
Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of
them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where
they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow,
cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a
patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk,
then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart.
"Excellent, Harry," Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk,
grinning. "Full marks."
Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione.
Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully
confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did
everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it.
After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.
"Hermione!" said Lupin, startled. "What's the matter?"
"P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!" Hermione gasped, pointing into the
trunk. "Sh -- she said I'd failed everything!"
It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had
regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle.
Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an
argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.
Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing
there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.
"Hello there, Harry!" he said. "Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly
finished?"
"Yes," said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with
the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.
"Lovely day," said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.
"Pity... pity..."
266
He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.
"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a
mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black
situation, I was asked to step in."
"Does that mean the appeal's already happened?" Ron interrupted,
stepping forward.
"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon," said Fudge, looking
curiously at Ron.
"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!" said Eon
stoutly. "The hippogriff might get off!"
Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors
behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their
very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache.
Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted
toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, "Dear, dear, I'm
getting too old for this.... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?"
The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry
looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a
shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged
him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.
"Why'd you stop me?" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for
lunch. "Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't
justice!"
"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like
that to his boss!" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. "As
long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly,
they can't possibly execute Buckbeak...."
But Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying.
267
All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch,
happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join
in.
Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies.
They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the
first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh,
where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to
Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute
studying.
"She's seeing us all separately," Neville informed them as they went to
sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on
his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. "Have either of you ever
seen anything in a crystal ball?" he asked them unhappily.
"Nope," said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry.
knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.
The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each
person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class
hissed, "What did she ask? Was it okay?"
But they all refused to say.
"She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a
horrible accident!" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the
ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.
"That's convenient," snorted Ron. "You know, I'm starting to think
Hermione was right about her" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor
overhead -- "she's a right old fraud."
"Yeah," said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock.
"Wish she'd hurry up..."
Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.
"She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer," she informed Harry
268
and Ron. "I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!"
She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.
"Ronald Weasley," said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.
Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry
was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the
floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the
sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.
Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the
ladder.
"How'd it go?" Harry asked him, standing up.
"Rubbish," said Ron. "Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up.
Don't think she was convinced, though...."
"Meet you in the common room," Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's
voice called, "Harry Potter!"
The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed,
the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he
stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor
Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.
"Good day, my dear," she said softly. "If you would kindly gaze into the
Orb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it...."
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,
willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but
nothing happened.
"Well?" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. "What do you see?"
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron
had just said, and decided to pretend.
"Er --" said Harry, "a dark shape... um..."
269
"What does it resemble?" whispered Professor Trelawney. "Think, now..."
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
"A hippogriff," he said firmly.
"Indeed!" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the
parchment perched upon her knees. "My boy, you may well be seeing the
outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look
closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?"
"Yes," said Harry firmly.
"Are you sure?" Professor Trelawney urged him. "Are you quite sure,
dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy
figure raising an axe behind it?"
"No!" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.
"No blood? No weeping Hagrid?"
"No!" said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the
heat. "It looks fine, it's - - flying away..."
Professor Trelawney sighed.
"Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there.... A little disappointing...
but I'm sure you did your best."
Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a
loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.
"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT."
Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her
armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.
"S -- sorry?" said Harry.
270
But Professor Trelawney didn't seem to hear him. Her eyes started to
roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to
have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the
hospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same
harsh voice, quite unlike her own:
"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY
HIS FOLLOWERS.
HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT,
BEFORE
MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO
REJOIN HIS
MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANTS
AID, GREATER AND
MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT... BEFORE
MIDNIGHT... THE
SERVANT... WILL SET OU... TO REJOIN... HIS MASTER....
Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest. She made a
grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite
suddenly, Professor Trelawney's head snapped up again.
"I'm so sorry, dear boy," she said dreamily, "the heat of the day, you
know... I drifted off for a moment...."
Harry sat there, staring at her.
"Is there anything wrong, my dear?"
"You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord's going to rise
again... that his servant's going to go back to him.
Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.
"The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that's hardly
something to joke about.... Rise again, indeed --"
,'But you just said it! You. said the Dark Lord --"
"I think you must have dozed off too, dear!" said Professor Trelawney.
271
"I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched
as that!"
Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase,
wondering... had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real
prediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test?
Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the
entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney's words still
resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite
direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of
long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and
entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner,
however, sat Ron and Hermione.
"Professor Trelawney," Harry panted, "just told me --"
But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.
"Buckbeak lost," said Ron weakly. "Hagrid's just sent this."
Hagrid's note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his
hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly
legible.
Lost appeal. They're going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do.
Don't come down. I don't want you to see it.
Hagrid
"We've got to go," said Harry at once. "He can't just sit there on his
own, waiting for the executioner!"
"Sunset, though," said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed
sort of way. "We'd never be allowed... 'specially you, Harry...."
Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.
"If we only had the Invisibility Cloak...."
272
"Where is it?" said Hermione.
Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed
witch.
"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I'm in serious
trouble," he finished.
"That's true," said Hermione, getting to her feet. "If he sees you....
How do you open the witch's hump again?"
"You -- you tap it and say, 'Dissendium,'" said Harry. "But --"
Hermione didn't wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the
room, pushed open the Fat Lady's portrait and vanished from sight.
"She hasn't gone to get it?" Ron said, staring after her.
She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery
cloak folded carefully under her robes.
"Hermione, I don't know what's gotten, into you lately!" said Ron,
astounded. "First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor
Trelawney --"
Hermione looked rather flattered.
They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to
Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of
his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They skulked
in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were
sure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across
the hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door.
"Okay," she whispered, "no one there -- cloak on --"
Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed
the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front
steps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden
Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees.
273
They reached Hagrid's cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering,
and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and
trembling.
"It's us," Harry hissed. "We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us
in and we can take it off."
"Yeh shouldn've come!" Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they
stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the
cloak.
Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He
looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This
helplessness was worse to watch than tears.
"Wan' some tea?" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for
the kettle.
"Where's Buckbeak, Hagrid?" said Hermione hesitantly.
I -- I took him outside," said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table
as he filled up the jug. "He's tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he
oughta see the trees an' -- an' smell fresh air -- before
Hagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his
grasp and shattered all over the floor.
"I'll do it, Hagrid," said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting
to clean up the mess.
"There's another one in the cupboard," Hagrid said, sitting down and
wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back
hopelessly.
"Isn't there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?" Harry asked fiercely,
sitting down next to him. "Dumbledore --"
"He's tried," said Hagrid. "He's got no power ter overrule the
Committee. He told 'em Buckbeak's all right, but they're scared.... Yeh
274
know what Lucius Malfoy's like... threatened 'em, I expect... an' the
executioner, Macnair, he's an old pal o' Malfoy's... but it'll be quick
an' clean... an' I'll be beside him.... "
Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though
looking for some shred of hope or comfort.
"Dumbledore's gonna come down while it -- while it happens. Wrote me
this mornin'. Said he wants ter -- ter be with me. Great man,
Dumbledore...."
Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid's cupboard for another milk
jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the
new jug in her hands, fighting back tears.
"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid," she began, but Hagrid shook his
shaggy head.
"Yeh're ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don' wan' yeh
watchin'. An' yeh shouldn' be down here anyway... If Fudge an'
Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh'll be in big
trouble."
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione's face, but she hid them
from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk
bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.
"Ron, I don't believe it -- it's Scabbers!"
Ron gaped at her.
"What are you talking about?"
Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside
down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside,
Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.
"Scabbers!" said Ron blankly. "Scabbers, what are you doing here?"
He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers
275
looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had
fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron's hands as
though desperate to free himself
"It's okay, Scabbers!" said Ron. "No cats! There's nothing here to hurt
you!"
Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally
ruddy face had gone the color of parchment.
"They're comin'...."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down
the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver
beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge.
Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner,
Macnair.
"Yeh gotta go," said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. "They
mustn' find yeh here.... Go now..."
Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak.
"I'll let yeh out the back way," said Hagrid.
They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely
unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered
to a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know
something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side and
pawed the ground nervously.
"It's okay, Beaky," said Hagrid softly. "It's okay..." He turned to
Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Go on," he said. "Get goin'."
But they didn't move.
"Hagrid, we can't --"
"We'll tell them what really happened --"
"They can't kill him --"
276
"Go!" said Hagrid fiercely. "It's bad enough without you lot in trouble
an' all!"
They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they
heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where
they had just vanished from sight.
"Go quick," he said hoarsely. "Don' listen...."
And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.
Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off
silently around Hagrid's house. As they reached the other side, the
front door closed with a sharp snap.
"Please, let's hurry," Hermione whispered. "I can't stand it, I can't
bear it...."
They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking
fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the
west there was a ruby-red glow.
Ron stopped dead.
"Oh, please, Ron," Hermione began.
"It's Scabbers -- he won't -- stay put --"
Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat
was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to
sink his teeth into Ron's hand.
"Scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's Ron," Ron hissed.
They heard a door open behind them and men's voices.
"Oh, Ron, please let's move, they're going to do it!" Hermione breathed.
"Okay -- Scabbers, stay put --"
277
They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to
the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again.
"I can't hold him -- Scabbers, shut up, everyone'll hear us --"
The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the
sounds drifting from Hagrid's garden. There was a jumble of indistinct
male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable
swish and thud of an axe.
Hermione swayed on the spot.
"They did it!" she whispered to Harry. "I d -- don't believe it -- they
did it!"
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
CAT, RAT, AND DOG
Harry's mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood
transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays
of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed
grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.
"Hagrid," Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he
made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.
"We can't," said Ron, who was paper-white. "He'll be in worse trouble if
they know we've been to see him...."
Hermione's breathing was shallow and uneven.
"How -- could -- they?" she choked. "How could they?"
"Come on," said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.
They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves
hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.
278
By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell
around them.
"Scabbers, keep still," Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest.
The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force
Scabbers deeper into his pocket. "What's the matter with you, You stupid
rat? Stay still -- OUCH! He bit me!"
"Ron, be quiet!" Hermione whispered urgently. "Fudge'll be out here in a
minute --"
"He won't -- stay -- put --"
Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might,
trying to break free of Ron's grip.
"What's the matter with him?"
But Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them, his body low to the
ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks.
Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers's
squeaks, Harry couldn't tell.
"Crookshanks!" Hermione moaned. "No, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!"
But the cat was getting nearer --
"Scabbers -- NO!"
Too late -- the rat had slipped between Ron's clutching fingers, hit the
ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him,
and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the
Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.
"Ron!" Hermione moaned.
She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it ""as
impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it
streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could
hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.
279
"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --"
There was a loud thud.
"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --"
Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in
front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in
his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.
"Ron -- come on back under the cloak --" Hermione panted. "Dumbledore
the Minister -- they'll be coming back out in a minute --"
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even
catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws....
Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow -- an enormous,
pale-eyed, jet-black dog.
Harry reached for his wand, but too late -- the dog had made an enormous
leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in
a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch- long teeth -
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him.
Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up;
he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry
aside; the dog's jaws fastened instead around Ron's outstretched arm.
Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute's hair, but it
was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll --
Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was
knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall
too.
Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes
"Lumos!"he whispered.
280
The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased
Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were
creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop
them going nearer.
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward
into a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously, but his
head and torso were slipping out of sight --
"Ron!" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped
lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.
All they could see now was one of Ron's legs, which he had hooked around
a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground
-- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron's leg had
broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.
"Harry -- we've got to go for help --" Hermione gasped; she was bleeding
too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.
"No! That thing's big enough to eat him; we haven't got time --"
"Harry -- we're never going to get through without help --"
Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.
"If that dog can get in, we can," Harry panted, darting here and there,
trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he
couldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of
the tree's blows.
"Oh, help, help," Hermione whispered frantically, dancing U._ certainly
on the spot, "Please..."
Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches
like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.
Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped
moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.
281
"Crookshanks!" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry's
arm painfully hard. "How did he know --?"
"He's friends with that dog," said Harry grimly. "I've seen them
together. Come on -- and keep your wand out --"
They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had
reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick
of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst,
and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.
Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from
Harry's wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.
"Where's Ron?" she whispered in a terrified voice.
"This way," said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.
"Where does this tunnel come out?" Hermione asked breathlessly from
behind him.
"I don't know... It's marked on the Marauder's Map but Fred and George
said no one's ever gotten into it.... It goes off the edge of the map,
but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade..."
They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them,
Crookshanks's tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the
passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes.... All Harry
could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to
him.... He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a
crouch....
And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and
Crookshanks had gone. instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light
through a small opening.
He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised
their wands to see what lay beyond.
It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the
walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture
282
was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all
boarded up.
Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.
Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was
deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy
hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm again. Her wide eyes were
traveling around the boarded windows.
"Harry," she whispered, "I think we're in the Shrieking Shack."
Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large
chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off
entirely.
"Ghosts didn't do that," he said slowly.
At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had Moved
upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione's grip on
Harry's arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers. He raised
his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.
Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and UP the crumbling
staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the
floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being
dragged upstairs.
They reached the dark landing.
"Nox," they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands
went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard
movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They
exchanged a last look, a last nod.
Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.
On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks,
purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching
his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.
283
Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.
"Ron -- are you okay?"
"Where's the dog?"
"Not a dog," Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. "Harry, it's
a trap --"
"What --"
"He's the dog... he's an Animagus."
Ron was staring over Harry's shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a
snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn't been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The
waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked
like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius
Black.
"Expelliarmus!"he croaked, pointing Ron's wand at them.
Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air,
and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed
on Harry.
"I thought you'd come and help your friend," he said hoarsely.
His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using
it. "Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you) not to
run for a teacher. I'm grateful... it will make everything much
easier...."
The taunt about his father rang in Harry's ears as though Black had
bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry's chest, leaving no place
for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his
hand, not to defend himself, but to attack... to kill. Without knowing
284
what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement
on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him
back.... "No, Harry!" Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron,
however, spoke to Black.
"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!" he said
fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of
still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.
Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes.
"Lie down," he said quietly to Ron. "You will damage that leg even
more."
"Did you hear me?" Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to
Harry to stay upright. "You'll have to kill all three of us!"
"There'll be only one murder here tonight," said Brack, and his grin
widened.
"Why's that?" Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and
Hermione. "Didn't care last time, did you? Didn't mind slaughtering all
those Muggles to get at Pettigrew... What's the matter, gone soft in
Azkaban?"
"Harry!" Hermione whimpered. "Be quiet!"
"HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!" Harry roared, and with a huge effort he
broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward -
He had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and
skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man -- all
Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and
that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return --
Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black
didn't raise the wands in time -- one of Harry's hands fastened over his
wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other
hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward,
into the wall -
285
Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as
the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed
Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers
twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of
Black it could find.
But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat
"No," he hissed, "I've waited too long --"
The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.
Then he saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry
with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and
Harry heard a faint clatter --
He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling
across the floor; he threw himself toward it but
"Argh!"
Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk
themselves deep into Harry's arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks
now darted toward Harry's wand --
"NO YOU DON'T!" roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that
made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned
-
"Get out of the way!" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.
They didn't need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip
bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron's wands. Ron crawled
to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now
tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and
fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand
pointing straight at Black's heart.
286
"Going to kill me, Harry?" he whispered.
Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black's chest,
looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black's left eye
and his nose was bleeding.
"You killed my parents," said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his
wand hand quite steady.
Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.
"I don't deny it," he said very quietly. "But if you knew the whole
story."
"The whole story?" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. "You
sold them to Voldemort. That's all I need to know."
"You've got to listen to me," Black said, and there was a note of
urgency in his voice now. "You'll regret it if you don't.... You don't
understand...."
"I understand a lot better than you think," said Harry, and his voice
shook more than ever. "You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying to
stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it...."
Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked
past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black's chest and settled himself
there, right over Black's heart. Black blinked and looked down at the
cat.
"Get off," he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.
But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black's robes and wouldn't shift. He
turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those
great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.
Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the
wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with
Black.... If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that
287
wasn't Harry's business.... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved
he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents....
Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment
to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to
kill Black. This was his chance....
The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised,
Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron's ragged
breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.
And then came a new sound -
Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was
moving downstairs.
"WE'RE UP HERE!" Hermione screamed suddenly. "WE'RE UP HERE --
SIRIUS
BLACK - QUICK!"
Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry
gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head --
but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn't
done it.
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry
wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face
bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying
on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry,
standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself,
crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.
"Expelliarmus!" Lupin shouted.
Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was
holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring
at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest.
Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn't done it. His nerve
had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.
288
Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.
"Where is he, Sirius?"
Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn't understannd what Lupin meant.
Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.
Black's face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn't move
at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight
at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.
"But then..." Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he
was trying to read his mind, "... why hasn't he shown himself before
now? Unless" -- Lupin's eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing
something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, "-- unless
he was the one... unless you switched... without telling me?"
Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin's face, Black nodded.
"Professor," Harry interrupted loudly, "what's going on --?"
But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice
die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black.
The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to his
feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a
brother.
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.
"DON'T BELIEVE IT!" Hermione screamed.
Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the
floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. "You -- you --"
"Hermione --"
"-- you and him!"
"Hermione, calm down --"
289
"I didn't tell anyone!" Hermione shrieked. "I've been covering up for
you --"
"Hermione, listen to me, please'" Lupin shouted. "I can explain --"
Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave
of fury.
"I trusted you," he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of
control, "and all the time you've been his friend!"
"You're wrong," said Lupin. "I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am
now -- Let me explain...."
"NO!" Hermione screamed. "Harry, don't trust him, he's been helping
Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he's a werewolf!"
There was a ringing silence. Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin, who
looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.
"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione," he said. "Only one out
of three, I'm afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle
and I certainly don't want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his
face. "But I won't deny that I am a werewolf."
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper
of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, "Get
away ftom me, werewolf!"
Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione
and said, "How long have you known?"
"Ages," Hermione whispered. "Since I did Professor Snape's essay..."
"He'll be delighted," said Lupin coolly. "He assigned that essay hoping
someone would realize what my symptoms meant.... Did you check the lunar
chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you
realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?"
290
"Both," Hermione said quietly.
Lupin forced a laugh.
"You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione."
"I'm not," Hermione whispered. "If I'd been a bit cleverer, I'd have
told everyone what you are!"
"But they already know," said Lupin. "At least, the staff do."
"Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped. "Is
he mad?"
"Some of the staff thought so," said Lupin. "He had to work very hard to
convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy --"
"AND HE WAS WRONG!" Harry yelled. "YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL
THE TIME!"
He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed
and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt
up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from
both of them, dragging his leg.
I have not been helping Sirius," said Lupin. "If you'll give me a
chance, I'll explain. Look --"
He separated Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to
its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.
There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt "You're
armed, we're not. Now will you listen?"
Harry didn't know what to think. Was it a trick?
"If you haven't been helping him," he said, with a furious glance at
Black, "how did you know he was here?"
"The map," said Lupin. "The Marauder's Map. I was in my office examining
it --"
291
"You know how to work it?" Harry said suspiciously.
"Of course I know how to work it," said Lupin, waving his hand
impatiently. "I helped write it. I'm Moony -- that was my friends'
nickname for me at school."
"You wrote --?"
"The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening,
because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak
out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed.
And I was right, wasn't I"
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of
dust rose at his feet.
"You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry--"
"How d'you know about the cloak?"
"The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...," said Lupin,
waving an impatient hand again. "The point is, even if you're wearing an
Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watched
you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, you
left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now
accompanied by somebody else."
"What?" said Harry. "No, we weren't!"
I couldn't believe my eyes," said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring
Harry's interruption. "I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How
could he be with you?" "No one was with us!" said Harry.
"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius
Black.... I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you
into the Whomping Willow --"
"One of us!" Ron said angrily.
292
"No, Ron," said Lupin. "Two of you."
He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.
"Do you think I could have a look at the rat?" he said evenly.
"What?" said Ron. "What's Scabbers got to do with it?"
"Everything," said Lupin. "Could I see him, please?"
Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged,
thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him
escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing
noise.
Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he
gazed intently at Scabbers.
"What?" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared.
"What's my rat got to do with anything?"
"That's not a rat," croaked Sirius Black suddenly.
"What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --"
"No, he's not," said Lupin quietly. "He's a wizard."
"An Animagus," said Black, "by the name of Peter Pettigrew."
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS
It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in.
Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.
"You're both mental."
"Ridiculous!" said Hermione faintly.
293
"Peter Pettigrew's dead!" said Harry. "He killed him twelve years ago!"
He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.
"I meant to," he growled, his yellow teeth bared, "but little Peter got
the better of me... not this time, though!"
And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron
yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg.
."Sirius, NO!" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging
Black away from Ron again, "WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they
need to understand -- we've got to explain --"
"We can explain afterwards!" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off.
One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who
was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried
to escape.
"They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!" Lupin
panted, still trying to restrain Black. "Ron's kept him as a pet! There
are parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the
truth, Sirius!"
Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on
Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad
bleeding hands.
"All right, then," Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.
"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit
the murder I was imprisoned for..."
"You're nutters, both of you," said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry
and Hermione for support. "I've had enough of this. I'm off."
He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand
again, pointing it at Scabbers.
"You're going to hear me out, Ron," he said quietly. "Just keep a tight
hold on Peter while you listen."
294
"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back
into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and
overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed.
Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.
There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die," he said. "A whole street
full of them..."
"They didn't see what they thought they saw!" said Black savagely, still
watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.
"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter," said Lupin, nodding. "I believed
it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map
never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry."
Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:
Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense
whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have
unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?
Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as
though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.
"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be
true, you know it can't..."
"Why can't it be true?" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class,
and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with
grindylows.
"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an
Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I
looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps
tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register
showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I
went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have
been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the
list."
295
Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put
into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.
"Light again, Hermione!" he said. "But the Ministry never knew that here
used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts."
"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus," said
Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. "I've
waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer."
"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius," said Lupin, I only
know how it began..."
Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom
door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then
Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.
"No one there..."
"This place is haunted!" said Ron.
"It's not," said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. "The
Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the
villagers used to hear were made by me."
He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then
said, "That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf,
None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I
hadn't been so foolhardy..."
He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said,
"Shh!" She was watching Lupin very intently.
"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried
everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that
Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It
makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the
full moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I'm able to curl up in my
office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.
296
"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully
fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able
to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children
exposed to me.
"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said
that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I
shouldn't come to school...." Lupin sighed, and looked directly at
Harry. "I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the
year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came
to Hogwarts. This house" -- Lupin looked miserably around the room, --
"the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once a
month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform.
The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me
while I was dangerous."
Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening
raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was
Scabbers's frightened squeaking.
"My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very
painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so
I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and
the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent
spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor.... Even now, when the house
has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it...."
"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been
in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends.
Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry --
James Potter."
"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared
once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was
ill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would
desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they,
like you, Hermione, worked out the truth...."
"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me
that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times
297
of my life. They became Animagi."
"My dad too?" said Harry, astounded.
"Yes, indeed," said Lupin. "It took them the best part of three years to
work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest
students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus
transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a
close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he
could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they
managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will."
"But how did that help you?" said Hermione, sounding puzzled.
"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as
animals," said Lupin. "A werewolf is only a danger to people. They
sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak.
They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the
Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They
would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I
became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to
become less so while I was with them."
"Hurry up, Remus," snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a
horrible sort of hunger on his face.
"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting
possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we
were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the
village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals,
they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts
students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade
than we did.... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and
sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James
was Prongs."
"What sort of animal --?" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off.
"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a
werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?"
298
"A thought that still haunts me," said Lupin heavily. "And there were
near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were
young, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness."
I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course...
he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done
so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my
own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students
into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my
guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's
adventure. And I haven't changed..."
Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. "All
this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should
tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why?
Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd
betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others
along with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He
let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been
shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I
am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school
using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had
nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all
along."
"Snape?" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first
time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. "What's Snape got to do with
it?"
"He's here, Sirius," said Lupin heavily. "He's teaching here as well."
He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my
appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been
telling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted. He has his
reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly
killed him, a trick which involved me --"
Black made a derisive noise.
299
"It served him right," he sneered. "Sneaking around, trying to find out
what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled...."
"Severus was very interested in where I went every month." Lupin told
Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "We were in the same year, you know, and we --
er -- didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James.
Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway
Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as
she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it
would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the
knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in
after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he'd got as far as this
house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd
heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at
great risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the
tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that
time on he knew what I was...."
"So that's why Snape doesn't like you," said Harry slowly, "because he
thought you were in on the joke?"
"That's right," sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.
Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing,
directly at Lupin.
CHAPTER NINETEEN
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT
Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd
received a huge electric shock.
"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow," said Snape, throwing
the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's
chest. "Very useful, Potter, I thank you...."
Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed
triumph. "You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?" he said,
300
his eyes glittering. "I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot
to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky
I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One
glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this
passageway and out of sight."
"Severus --" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.
"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old
friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I
dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout
--"
"Severus, you're making a mistake," said Lupin urgently. "You haven't
heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry
--"
"Two more for Azkaban tonight," said Snape, his eyes now gleaming
fanatically. "I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this....
He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame
werewolf --"
"You fool," said Lupin softly. "Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an
innocent man back inside Azkaban?"
BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and
twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he
overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,
Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between
Black's eyes.
"Give me a reason," he whispered. "Give me a reason to do it, and I
swear I will."
Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face
showed more hatred.
Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe.
He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he
did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione,
301
however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very
breathless voice, "Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what
they've got to say, w -- would it?"
"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,"
Snape spat. "You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company
of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your
tongue."
"But if -- if there was a mistake --"
"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite
deranged. "DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!" A
few sparks
shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's
face. Hermione fell silent.
"Vengeance is very sweet," Snape breathed at Black. "How I hoped I would
be the one to catch you...."
"The joke's on you again, Severus," Black snarled. "As long as this boy
brings his rat up to the castle" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- "I'll
come quietly...."
"Up to the castle?" said Snape silkily. "I don't think we need to go
that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the
Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to
give you a little kiss, I daresay... I --"
What little color there was in Blacks face left it.
"You -you've got to hear me out," he croaked. "The rat -- look at the
rat --"
But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen
before. He seemed beyond reason.
"Come on, all of you," he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of
the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. "I'll drag the werewolf.
Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --"
302
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three
strides and blocked the door.
"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already," snarled
Snape. "If I hadn't been here to save your skin --"
"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,"
Harry said. "I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense
lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he
just finish me off then?"
"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works," hissed Snape.
"Get out of the way, Potter."
"YOURE PATHETIC!" Harry yelled. "JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL
OF YOU AT
SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --"
"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!" Snape shrieked,
looking
madder than ever. "Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your
neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well
served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too
arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the
way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!"
Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even
one step toward him, he had raised his wand.
"Expelliarmus!" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that
shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges;
Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down
it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had
been knocked out.
Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at
exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on
the bed next to Crookshanks.
303
"You shouldn't have done that," said Black, looking at Harry.
"You should have left him to me...."
Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the
right thing.
"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher..." Hermione whimpered,
staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. "Oh, we're going to
be in so much trouble --"
Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and
untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had
cut into them.
"Thank you, Harry," he said.
"I'm still not saying I believe you," he told Lupin.
"Then it's time we offered you some proof," said Lupin. "You, boy --
give me Peter, please. Now."
Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.
"Come off it," he said weakly. "Are you trying to say he broke out of
Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean..." He looked up at
Harry and Hermione for support, "Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a
rat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which one
he's after if he was locked up in Azkaban?"
"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question," said Lupin, turning to Black
and frowning slightly. "How did you find out where he was?"
Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a
crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the
others.
It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the
Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was
Scabbers.
304
"How did you get this?" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.
"Fudge," said Black. "When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave
me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy's
shoulder... I knew him at once... how many times had I seen him
transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to
Hogwarts... to where Harry was...
"My God," said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the
paper and back again. "His front paw..."
"What about it?" said Ron defiantly.
"He's got a toe missing," said Black.
"Of course," Lupin breathed. "So simple... so brilliant... he cut it off
himself?"
"Just before he transformed," said Black. "When I cornered him, he
yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James.
Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand
behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and
sped down into the sewer with the other rats...."
"Didn't you ever hear, Ron?" said Lupin. "The biggest bit of Peter they
found was his finger."
"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's
been in my family for ages, right --"
"Twelve years, in fact," said Lupin. "Didn't you ever wonder why he was
living so long?"
"We -- we've been taking good care of him!" said Ron.
"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?" said Lupin. "I'd
guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the
loose again...."
305
"He's been scared of that mad cat!" said Ron, nodding toward
Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.
But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been
looking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron's return from
Egypt... since the time when Black had escaped....
"This cat isn't mad," said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand
and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. "He's the most intelligent of his
kind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And
when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted
me.... Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and
he's been helping me. .. "What do you mean?" breathed Hermione.
"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't... so he stole the
passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me.... As I understand it, he took
them from a boy's bedside table...."
Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was
hearing. It was absurd... and yet...
"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it." croaked Black.
"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left
blood on the sheets.... I supposed he bit himself... Well, faking his
own death had worked once."
These words jolted Harry to his senses.
"And why did he fake his death?" he said furiously. "Because he knew you
were about to kill him like you killed my parents!"
"No," said Lupin, "Harry-"
"And now you've come to finish him off!"
"Yes, I have," said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.
"Then I should've let Snape take you!" Harry shouted.
"Harry," said Lupin hurriedly, "don't you see? All this time we've
306
thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but
it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother
and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --"
"THAT'S NOT TRUE!" Harry yelled. "HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE
SAID SO
BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!"
He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes
were suddenly over bright.
"Harry... I as good as killed them," he croaked. "I persuaded Lily and
James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him
as Secret-Keeper instead of me.... I'm to blame, I know it.... The night
they died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe,
but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no sign
of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your
parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and
their bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done...."
His voice broke. He turned away.
"Enough of this," said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice
Harry had never heard before. "There's one certain way to prove what
really happened. Ron, give me that rat."
"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?" Ron asked
Lupin tensely.
"Force him to show himself," said Lupin. "If he really is a rat, it
won't hurt him."
Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took
him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning,
his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. "Ready, Sirius?" said Lupin.
Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He approached
Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be
burning in his face.
307
"Together?" he said quietly.
"I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his
wand in the other. "On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!"
A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment,
Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron
yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding
flash of light and then --
It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was
shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a
man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his
hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his
back was standing up.
He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His
thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on
top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of
weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers's
fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his
very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing
fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.
"Well, hello, Peter," said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently
erupted into old school friends around him. "Long time, no see.
"S -- Sirius... R -- Remus..." Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky.
Again, his eyes darted toward the door. "My friends... my old
friends..."
Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a
warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and
casual.
"We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night
Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you
were squeaking around down there on the bed --"
"Remus," gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking
308
out over his pasty face, "you don't believe him, do you...? He tried to
kill me, Remus...."
"So we've heard," said Lupin, more coldly. "I'd like to clear up one or
two little matters with you, Peter, if you'll be so --"
"He's come to try and kill me again!" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly,
pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because
his index was missing. "He killed Lily and James and now he's going to
kill me too.... You've got to help me, Remus...."
Black's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew
with his fathomless eyes.
"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things
out," said Lupin.
"Sorted things out?" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once
more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again' the only door. "I
knew he'd come after me! I knew he'd be back for me! I've been waiting
for this for twelve years!"
"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?" said Lupin, his
brow furrowed. "When nobody has ever done it before?"
"He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!" Pettigrew
shouted shrilly. "How else did he get out of there? I suppose
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!"
Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the
whole room.
"Voldemort, teach me tricks?" he said.
Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.
"What, scared to hear your old master's name?" said Black. I don't blame
you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?"
"Don't know what you mean, Sirius --" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing
309
faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.
"You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years," said Black. "You've
been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban,
Peter... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them....
I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds
like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went
to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall
there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they?
There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've
seen the error of their ways.
If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter --"
"Don't know... what you're talking about...," said Pettigrew again, more
shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at
Lupin. "You don't believe this -- this madness, Remus --"
"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent
man would want to spend twelve years as a rat," said Lupin evenly.
"Innocent, but scared!" squealed Pettigrew. "If Voldemort's supporters
were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban --
the spy, Sirius Black!"
Black's face contorted.
"How dare you," he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he
had been. I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people
who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I'll
never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start. You
always liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? It used to be
us... me and Remus... and James....
Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath.
"Me, a spy... must be out of your mind... never... don't know how you
can say such a --"
"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,"
310
Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. "I
thought it was the perfect plan... a bluff... Voldemort would be sure to
come after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thing
like you.... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life,
telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters."
Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like
"far-fetched" and "lunacy," but he couldn't help paying more attention
to the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued to
dart toward the windows and door.
"Professor Lupin?" said Hermione timidly. "Can -- can I say something?"
"Certainly, Hermione," said Lupin courteously.
"Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he's been sleeping in
Harry's dormitory for three years. If he's working for You-Know-Who, how
come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?"
"There!" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand.
"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head!
Why should I?"
"I'll tell you why," said Black. "Because you never did anything for
anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort's been in
hiding for fifteen years, they say he's half dead. You weren't about to
commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore's nose, for a wreck of a
wizard who'd lost all of his power, were you? You'd want to be quite
sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to
him, wouldn't you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in?
Keeping an ear out for news, weren't YOU, Peter? Just in case your old
protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him...."
Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to
have lost the ability to talk.
"Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?" said Hermione.
Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as
though he had never seen anything quite like her.
311
"If you don't mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if
you didn't use Dark Magic?"
"Thank you!" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. "Exactly!
Precisely what I --"
But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at
Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be
pondering his answer.
"I don't know how I did it," he said slowly. "I think the only reason I
never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn't a happy
thought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me... but it kept me
sane and knowing who I am... helped me keep my powers... so when it all
became ... too much... I could transform in my cell... become a dog.
Dementors can't see, you know...." He swallowed. "They feel their way
toward people by feeding off their emotions.... They could tell that my
feelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog... but
they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in
there, so it didn't trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had
no hope of driving them away from me without a wand...."
"But then I saw Peter in that picture... I realized he was at Hogwarts
with Harry... perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears
that the Dark Side was gathering strength again...."
Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all
the while at Black as though hypnotized.
"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies... and to
deliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who'd dare say
he'd betrayed Lord Voldemort? He'd be welcomed back with honors....
"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter
was still alive...."
Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. "The guards say
he's been talking in his sleep... always the same words... 'He's at
Hogwarts.'"
312
"It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the dementors
couldn't destroy it.... It wasn't a happy feeling... it was an
obsession... but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night
when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog....
It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were
confused.... I was thin, very thin... thin enough to slip through the
bars.... I swam as a dog back to the mainland.... I journeyed north and
slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I've been living in the
forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course.
You fly as well as your father did, Harry...."
He looked at Harry, who did not look away.
"Believe me," croaked Black. "Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James
and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them."
And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he
nodded.
"No!"
Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry's nod had been his own
death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands
clasped in front of him as though praying.
"Sirius -- it's me... it's Peter... your friend... you wouldn't --"
Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.
"There's enough filth on my robes without you touching them," said
Black.
"Remus!" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing
imploringly in front of him. "You don't believe this wouldn't Sirius
have told you they'd changed the plan?"
"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter," said Lupin. "I assume that's
why you didn't tell me, Sirius?" he said casually over Pettigrews head.
313
"Forgive me, Remus," said Black.
"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend," said Lupin, who was now rolling up
his sleeves. "And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were
the spy?"
"Of course," said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his
gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. "Shall we kill him
together?"
"Yes, I think so," said Lupin grimly.
"You wouldn't... you won't...," gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled
around to Ron.
"Ron... haven't I been a good friend... a good pet? You won't let them
kill me, Ron, will you... you're on my side, aren't you.
But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.
"I let you sleep in my bed!" he said.
"Kind boy... kind master..." Pettigrew crawled toward Ron "You won't let
them do it.... I was your rat.... I was a good pet...."
"If you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about,
Peter," said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched
his broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees,
staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione's robes.
"Sweet girl... clever girl... you -- you won't let them.... Help me...."
Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed
away against the wall, looking horrified.
Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and-turned his head slowly
toward Harry.
"Harry... Harry... you look just like your father... just like him...."
314
"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?" roared Black. "HOW DARE YOU
FACE HIM? HOW
DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?"
"Harry," whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched.
"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed.... James would have
understood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy..."
Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew's shoulders, and
threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror,
staring up at them.
"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort," said Black, who was shaking too.
"Do you deny it?"
Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized,
balding baby, cowering on the floor.
"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord... you have no
idea... he has weapons you can't imagine.... I was scared, Sirius, I was
never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen....
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me --"
"DON'T LIE!" bellowed Black. "YOU'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO
HIM FOR
A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!"
"He -- he was taking over everywhere!" gasped Pettigrew. "Wh -- what was
there to be gained by refusing him?"
"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has
ever existed?" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. "Only
innocent lives, Peter!"
"You don't understand!" whined Pettigrew. "He would have killed me,
Sirius!"
"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!" roared Black. "DIED RATHER THAN
BETRAY YOUR
FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!"
315
Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.
"You should have realized," said Lupin quietly, "if Voldemort didn't
kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter."
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.
"NO!" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew,
facing the wands. "You can't kill him," he said breathlessly. "You
can't."
Black and Lupin both looked staggered.
"Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents," Black
snarled. "This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too,
without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more
to him than your whole family."
"I know," Harry panted. "We'll take him up to the castle. We'll hand him
over to the dementors.... He can go to Azkaban... but don't kill him."
"Harry!" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry's knees.
"You -- thank you -- it's more than I deserve -- thank you --"
"Get off me," Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew's hands off him in disgust.
"I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because -- I don't reckon my
dad would've wanted them to become killers -- just for you."
No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming
in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at
each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.
"You're the only person who has the right to decide, Harry," said Black.
"But think... think what he did...."
"He can go to Azkaban," Harry repeated. "If anyone deserves that place,
he does...."
Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.
316
"Very well," said Lupin. "Stand aside, Harry."
Harry hesitated.
"I'm going to tie him up," said Lupin. "That's all, I swear."
Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this
time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and
gagged.
"But if you transform, Peter," growled Black, his own wand pointing at
Pettigrew too, "we will kill you. You agree, Harry?"
Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that
Pettigrew could see him.
"Right," said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. "Ron, I can't mend bones
nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it's best if we just strap
your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing."
He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron's leg with his wand, and
muttered, "Ferula." Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to
a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on
the leg and didn't wince.
"That's better," he said. "Thanks."
"What about Professor Snape?" said Hermione in a small voice, looking
down at Snape's prone figure.
"There's nothing seriously wrong with him," said Lupin, bending over
Snape and checking his pulse. "You were just a little --
overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if we
don't revive him until we're safety back in the castle. We can take him
like this...."
He muttered, "Mobilicorpus." As though invisible strings were tied to
Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position,
head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few
317
inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the
Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket.
"And two of us should be chained to this," said Black, nudging Pettigrew
with his toe. "Just to make sure."
"I'll do it," said Lupin.
"And me," said Ron savagely, limping forward.
Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright
again, left arm chained to Lupin's right, right arm to Ron's left. Ron's
face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as a
personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way
out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.
CHAPTER TWENTY
THE DEMENTOR'S KISS
Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way
down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like
entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting
creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up
by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and
Hermione brought up the rear.
Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron
had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered
with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in
single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after
Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept
bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression
Black was making no effort to prevent this.
"You know what this means?" Black said abruptly to Harry as they made
their slow progress along the tunnel. "Turning Pettigrew in?"
"You' re free," said Harry.
318
"Yes...," said Black. "But I'm also -- I don't know if anyone ever told
you -- I'm your godfather."
"Yeah, I knew that," said Harry.
"Well... your parents appointed me your guardian," said Black stiffly.
"If anything happened to them..."
Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant?
"I'll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and
uncle," said Black. "But... well... think about it. Once my name's
cleared... if you wanted a... a different home..."
Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry's stomach.
"What -- live with you?" he said, accidentally cracking his head on a
bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. "Leave the Dursleys?"
"Of course, I thought you wouldn't want to," said Black quickly. "I
understand, I just thought I'd --"
"Are you insane?" said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black's.
"Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can
I move in?"
Black turned right around to look at him; Snape's head was scraping the
ceiling but Black didn't seem to care.
"You want to?" he said. "You mean it?"
"Yeah, I mean it!" said Harry.
Black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon
it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years
younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was
recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry's parents' wedding.
They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel.
319
Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the
knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upward
without any sound of savaging branches.
Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and
Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.
The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant
windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still
wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry's mind was buzzing. He was
going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his
parents' best friend.... He felt dazed.... What would happen when he
told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they'd seen on
television... !
"One wrong move, Peter," said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was
still pointed sideways at Pettigrew's chest.
Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing
slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his chin
bumping on his chest. And then -
A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their
party was bathed in moonlight.
Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly.
Black froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.
Harry could see Lupin's silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs
began to shake.
"Oh, my --" Hermione gasped. "He didn't take his potion tonight! He's
not safe!"
"Run," Black whispered. "Run. Now."
But Harry couldn't run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt
forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back.
"Leave it to me -- RUN!"
320
There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin's head was lengthening. So
was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on
his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks's
hair was on end again; he was backing away --
As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from
Harry's side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded
forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it,
the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron
and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other.
Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to
notice anything else. It was Hermione's scream that alerted him --
Pettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his
bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light -- and Ron lay
motionless on the ground. Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the air
and back to the earth in a heap.
"Expelliarmus." Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew;
Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight. "Stay where you
are!" Harry shouted, running forward.
Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip
through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying
through the grass.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf
taking flight; it was galloping into the forest --
"Sirius, he's gone, Pettigrew transformed!" Harry yelled.
Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at
Harry's words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his
paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.
Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.
"What did he do to him?" Hermione whispered. Ron's eyes were only
321
half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could
hear him breathing, but he didn't seem to recognize them.
"I don't know...."
Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone... they had
no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.
"We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone," said Harry,
pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. "Come --"
But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a
whining: a dog in pain....
"Sirius," Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.
He had a moment's indecision, but there was nothing they could do for
Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble --
Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to
be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward
it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it
must mean -
The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw
why -- Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours,
his hands over his head.
'Nooo," he moaned. 'Nooo... please...."
And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding
in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the
familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his
vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were
encircling them....
"Herrnione, think of something happy!" Harry yelled, raising his wand,
blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid
it of the faint screaming that had started inside it --
322
I'm going to live with my godfather. I'm leaving the Dursleys.
He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant:
"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!"
Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground,
pale as death.
He'll be all right. I'm going to go and live with him.
"Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!"
"Expecto --" Hermione whispered, "expecto -- expecto --"
But she couldn't do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet
from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were
getting closer....
"EXPECTO PATRONUM!" Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his
ears. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"
A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him.
At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He was
alone... completely alone....
"Expecto -- expecto patronum --"
Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With
a huge effort, he fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent
-- We'll be okay -- I' mgoing to live with him --
"Ex ecto patronum!" he gasped.
By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, He saw a dementor halt,
very close to him. It couldn't walk through the cloud of silver mist
Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It
made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.
"No -- no --" Harry gasped. "He's innocent... expecto expecto patronum
--"
323
He could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil
wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him. Then
it raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood.
Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed
skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth... a
gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death
rattle.
A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak. His
Patronus flickered and died.
White fog was blinding him. He had to fight... expecto patronum ... he
couldn't see... and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming...
expecto patronum... he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his
arm... they weren't going to take him....
But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around
Harry's neck. They were forcing his face upward.... He could feel its
breath.... It was going to get rid of him first.... He could feel its
putrid breath.... His mother was screaming in his ears.... She was going
to be the last thing he ever heard --
And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a
silvery light growing brighter and brighter... He felt himself fall
forward onto the grass.... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,
Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The blinding
light was illuminating the grass around him.... The screaming had
stopped, the cold was ebbing away...
Something was driving the dementors back.... It was circling around him
and Black and Hermione.... They were leaving....
The air was warm again....
With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a
few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the
lake.... Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it
was.... It was as bright as a unicorn.... Fighting to stay conscious,
324
Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For
a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back...
raising his hand to pat it... someone who looked strangely familiar ...
but it couldn't be...
Harry didn't understand. He couldn't think anymore. He felt the last of
his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
HERMIONE'S SECRET
Shocking business... shocking... miracle none of them died... never
heard the like... by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape...."
"Thank you, Minister."
"Order of Merlin, Second Class, I'd say. First Class, if I can wangle
it!"
"Thank you very much indeed, Minister."
"Nasty cut you've got there.... Black's work, I suppose?"
"As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister...."
"No!"
"Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to
judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he
was innocent. They weren't responsible for their actions. On the other
hand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape.... They
obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They've
got away with a great deal before now... I'm afraid it's given them a
rather high opinion of themselves... and of course Potter has always
been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster --"
"Ah, well, Snape... Harry Potter, you know... we've all got a bit of a
blind spot where he's concerned."
325
"And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment?
Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other
student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his
friends into such danger. Consider, Minister -- against all school rules
-- after all the precautions put in place for his protection --
out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer --
and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally
too --"
"Well, well... we shall see, Snape, we shall see.... The boy has
undoubtedly been foolish...."
Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The
words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to
his brain, so that it was difficult to understand.... His limbs felt
like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift.... He wanted to lie here, on
this comfortable bed, forever....
"What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors... you've really
no idea what made them retreat, Snape?"
"No, Minister... by the time I had come 'round they were heading back to
their positions at the entrances...."
"Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --"
"All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black,
naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to
the castle."
There was a pause. Harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster,
and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach....
He opened his eyes.
Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He
was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he
could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed.
Harry squinted. Ron's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey's arm.
326
Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay
Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too.
She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake, pressed a
finger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar,
and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from
the corridor outside.
Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry's bed.
He turned to took at her. She was carrying the largest block of
chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.
"Ah, you're awake!" she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on
Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.
"How's Ron?" said Harry and Hermione together.
"He'll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. "As for you two you'll be
staying here until I'm satisfied you're -- Potter, what do you think
you're doing?"
Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his
wand.
"I need to see the headmaster," he said.
"Potter," said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, "it's all right. They've got
Black. He's locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the
kiss any moment now --"
"WHAT?"
Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout
had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and
Snape had entered the ward.
"Harry, Harry, what's this?" said Fudge, looking agitated. "You should
be in bed -- has he had any chocolate?" he asked Madam Pomfrey
anxiously.
"Minister, listen!" Harry said. "Sirius Black's innocent! Peter
327
Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can't let the
dementors do that thing to Sirius, he's --"
But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face.
"Harry, Harry, you're very confused, you've been through a dreadful
ordeal, lie back down, now, we've got everything under control...."
"YOU HAVEN'T!" Harry yelled. "YOUVE GOT THE WRONG MAN!"
"Minister, listen, please," Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry's
side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge's face. "I saw him too. It
was Ron's rat, he's an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and --"
"You see, Minister?" said Snape. "Confunded, both of them.... Black's
done a very good job on them...." "WE'RE NOT CONFUNDED!" Harry roared.
"Minister! Professor!" said Madam Pomfrey angrily. "I must insist that
you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!"
"I'm not distressed, I'm trying to tell them what happened!" Harry said
furiously. "If they'd just listen --"
But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into
Harry's mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him
back onto the bed.
"Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave
The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his mouthful
of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.
"Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black --"
"For heaven's sake!" said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. "Is this a
hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist --"
"My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss
Granger," said Dumbledore calmly. "I have just been talking to Sirius
Black --"
328
"I suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in Potter's
mind?" spat Snape. "Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --"
"That, indeed, is Black's story," said Dumbledore, surveying Snape
closely through his half-moon spectacles.
"And does my evidence count for nothing?" snarled Snape. "Peter
Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him
on the grounds."
"That was because you were knocked out, Professor!" said Hermione
earnestly. "You didn't arrive in time to hear
"Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!"
"Now, Snape," said Fudge, startled, "the young lady is disturbed in her
mind, we must make allowances --"
"I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone," said Dumbledore
abruptly. "Cornelius, Severus, Poppy -- please leave us."
"Headmaster!" sputtered Madam Pomfrey. "They need treatment, they need
rest --"
"This cannot wait," said Dumbledore. "I must insist."
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end
of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large
gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.
"The dementors should have arrived by now," he said. "I'll go and meet
them. Dumbledore, I'll see you upstairs."
He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn't
moved.
"You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?" Snape whispered, his
eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face.
329
"I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone," Dumbledore repeated.
Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.
"Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen," he
breathed. "You haven't forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven't forgotten
that he once tried to kill me?"
"My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus," said Dumbledore quietly.
Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still
holding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and
Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same time.
"Professor, Black's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew "-- he escaped
when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf --"
"-- he's a rat --"
"-- Pettigrew's front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off --"
"-- Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn't Sirius --"
But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations.
"It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because
there is very little time," he said quietly. "There is not a shred of
proof to support Black's story, except your word -- and the word of two
thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of
eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave
evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters'
Secret-Keeper."
"Professor Lupin can tell you --" Harry said, unable to stop himself
"Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone
anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius
will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted
by most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and
the fact that he and Sirius are old friends --"
330
"But --"
"Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see
that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing than
yours."
"He hates Sirius," Hermione said desperately. "All because of some
stupid trick Sirius played on him --"
"Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady
-- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive or
dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence."
"But you believe us."
"Yes, I do," said Dumbledore quietly. "But I have no power to make other
men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic...."
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground
beneath him were falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea
that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull
some amazing solution out of the air. But no ... their last hope was
gone.
"What we need," said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved
from Harry to Hermione, "is more time."
"But --" Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. "OH!"
"Now, pay attention," said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly. "Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the seventh
floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes
well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But
remember this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know
the law -- you know what is at stake.... You -- must -- not -- be --
seen."
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his
heel and looked back as he reached the door.
331
"I am going to lock you in. It is --" he consulted his watch, "five
minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck."
"Good luck?" Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. "Three
turns? What's he talking about? What are we supposed to do?"
But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from
beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.
"Harry, come here," she said urgently. "Quick!"
Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding the chain
out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it.
"Here --"
She had thrown the chain around his neck too.
"Ready?" she said breathlessly.
"What are we doing?" Harry said, completely lost.
Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.
The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very
fast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears
were pounding, he tried to yell but couldn't hear his own voice --
And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into
focus again --
He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a
stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the
open front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the
hourglass cutting into his neck.
"Hermione, what --?"
"In here!" Hermione seized Harry's arm and dragged him across the hall
332
to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among
the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.
"What -- how -- Hermione, what happened?"
"We've gone back in time," Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off
Harry's neck in the darkness. "Three hours back..."
Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot,
which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very
bizarre dream.
"But --"
"Shh! Listen! Someone's coming! I think -- I think it might be us!"
Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door.
"Footsteps across the hall... yes, I think it's us going down to
Hagrid's!"
"Are you telling me," Harry whispered, "that we're here in this cupboard
and we're out there too?"
"Yes," said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. "I'm
sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people... and we're
walking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -- "
She broke off, still listening intently.
"We've gone down the front steps...."
Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious,
but Harry wanted a few questions answered.
"Where did you get that hourglass thing?"
"It's called a Time-Turner," Hermione whispered, "and I got it from
Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year
to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn't
tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of
333
Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model
student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except my
studies.... I've been turning it back so I could do hours over again,
that's how I've been doing several lessons at once, see? But...
"Harry, I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he
tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?"
Harry stared at her shadowy face.
"There must be something that happened around now he wants us to
change," he said slowly. "What happened? We were walking down to
Hagrid's three hours ago...."
"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's," said
Hermione. "We just heard ourselves leaving...."
Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in
concentration.
"Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent
life...." And then it hit him. "Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!"
"But -- how will that help Sirius?"
"Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of
Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly
Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on
Buckbeak -- they can escape together!"
From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified.
"If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!"
"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?" said Harry. He stood up and
pressed his ear against the door. "Doesn't sound like anyone's there....
Come on, let's go."
Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As
quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and
334
down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of
the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.
"If anyone's looking out of the window --" Hermione squeaked, looking up
at the castle behind them.
"We'll run for it," said Harry determinedly. "Straight into the forest,
all right? We'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a
lookout --"
"Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!" said Hermione
breathlessly. "We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, or
we'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!"
Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione
behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses,
paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could,
skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the
forest....
Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later,
Hermione arrived beside him, panting.
"Right," she gasped. "We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of
sight, Harry...."
They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge
of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they
heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk
and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway,
shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry
heard his own voice.
"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can
take it off."
"Yeh shouldn've come!" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the
door quickly.
"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done," Harry said fervently.
335
"Let's move along a bit," Hermione whispered. "We need to get nearer to
Buckbeak!"
They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff,
tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.
"Now?" Harry whispered.
"No!" said Hermione. "If we steal him now, those Committee people will
think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's
tied outside!"
"That's going to give us about sixty seconds," said Harry. This was
starting to seem impossible.
At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's
cabin.
"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug," Hermione whispered. "I'm going to
find Scabbers in a moment --"
Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of
surprise.
"Hermione," said Harry suddenly, "what if we -- we just run in there and
grab Pettigrew --"
"No!" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. "Don't you understand? We're
breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to
change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --"
"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!"
"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into
Hagrid's house?" said Hermione.
"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad," said Harry, "or I'd think there was
some Dark Magic going on --"
336
"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't
you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened
when wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing
their past or future selves by mistake!"
"Okay!" said Harry. "It was just an idea, I just thought
But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his
head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors.
Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner
were coming down the steps.
"We're about to come out!" Hermione breathed.
And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw
himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was,
without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind
the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.
"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay..." Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned
to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Go on. Get goin'."
"Hagrid, we can't --"
"We'll tell them what really happened
"They can't kill him --"
"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!"
Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility
Cloak over him and Ron.
"Go quick. Don' listen...."
There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had
arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving
the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all
around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and
Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees
337
could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back
door.
"Where is the beast?" came the cold voice of Macnair.
"Out -- outside," Hagrid croaked.
Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at
Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.
"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid.
I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair,
You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --"
Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
"Wait here," Harry whispered to Hermione. "I'll do it."
As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,
shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --"
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.
"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai..."
"Come on, Buckbeak," Harry murmured, "come on, we're going to help you.
Quietly... quietly..."
"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here..."
Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his
front feet.
338
"Well, let's get this over with," said the reedy voice of the Committee
member from inside Hagrid's cabin. "Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if
you stay inside --"
"No, I -- I wan' ter be with him.... I don' wan' him ter be alone --"
Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.
"Buckbeak, move!" Harry hissed.
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff
began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet
away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. "One moment,
please, Macnair," came Dumbledore's voice. "You need to sign too." The
footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak
and walked a little faster.
Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.
"Harry, hurry!" she mouthed.
Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin.
He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot.
They had reached the trees....
"Quick! Quick!" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.
Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they
couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.
"Stop!" he whispered to Hermione. "They might hear us
Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak
stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Silence... then --
"Where is it?" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. "Where is
the beast?"
339
"It was tied here!" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just
here!"
"How extraordinary," said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his voice.
"Beaky!" said Hagrid huskily.
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the
howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs.
"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself
free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!"
Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to
Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into
the forest floor to stop him.
"Someone untied him!" the executioner was snarling. "We should search
the grounds, the forest."
"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the
thief will have led him away on foot?" said Dumbledore, still sounding
amused. "Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup
of tea. Or a large brandy."
"O' -- o' course, Professor," said Hagrid, who sounded weak with
happiness. "Come in, come in...."
Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft
cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once
more.
"Now what?" whispered Harry, looking around.
"We'll have to hide in here," said Hermione, who looked very shaken. "We
need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until
it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He won't be there for
340
another couple of hours.... Oh, this is going to be difficult...."
She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest.
The sun was setting now.
"We're going to have to move," said Harry, thinking hard. "We've got to
be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on."
"Okay," said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. "But
we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember...."
They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly
around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through
which they could make out the Willow.
"There's Ron!" said Harry suddenly.
A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through
the still night air.
"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --"
And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry
watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.
"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --"
"There's Sirius!" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out
from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize
Ron....
"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?" said Harry, watching the dog
pulling Ron into the roots. "Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the
tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--"
The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower
branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to
reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.
"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot," said Hermione.
341
"And there we go..." Harry muttered. "We're in."
The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds
later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge,
and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.
"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!" said Hermione. "If only
Dumbledore had come with us..."
"Macnair and Fudge would've come too," said Harry bitterly. "I bet you
anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot...."
They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from
view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --
"Here comes Lupin!" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down
the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the
sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the
knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too,
disappeared into the gap in its roots.
"If he'd only grabbed the cloak," said Harry. "It's just lying
there...."
He turned to Hermione.
"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get
it and --"
"Harry, we mustn't be seen!"
"How can you stand this?" he asked Hermione fiercely. "Just standing
here and watching it happen?" He hesitated. "I'm going to grab the
cloak!"
"Harry, no!"
342
Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just
then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to
the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he
walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.
"See?" Hermione whispered. "See what would have happened? We've got to
keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!"
The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry
seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched
Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped
fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.
Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and
Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.
Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the
tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.
"Get your filthy hands off it," Harry snarled under his breath. "Shh!"
Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the
knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.
"So that's it," said Hermione quietly. "We're all down there... and now
we've just got to wait until we come back up again...."
She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the
nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.
"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the
dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed
out... there were so many of them...."
Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest
dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had
come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.
Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.
343
"But what was it?"
"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,"
said Harry. "A real Patronus. A powerful one."
"But who conjured it?"
Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen
on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but
how could it have been?
"Didn't you see what they looked like?" said Hermione eagerly. "Was it
one of the teachers?"
"No," said Harry. "He wasn't a teacher."
"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those
dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it
light him up? Couldn't you see --?"
"Yeah, I saw him," said Harry slowly. "But... maybe I imagined it.... I
wasn't thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward...."
"Who did you think it was?"
I think --" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to
sound. I think it was my dad."
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now.
She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.
"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead," she said quietly.
"I know that," said Harry quickly.
"You think you saw his ghost?"
"I don't know... no... he looked solid...."
"But then --"
344
"Maybe I was seeing things," said Harry. "But... from what I could
see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him...."
Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.
I know it sounds crazy," said Harry flatly. He turned to took at
Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching
for worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak.
He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest
friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of them
been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening
when everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his
father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The
figure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure,
for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness....
The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in
and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face
turned toward the Willow, waiting.
And then, at last, after over an hour...
"Here we come!" Hermione whispered.
She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw
Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the
roots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting
weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward
the castle.
Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky.
Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon....
"Harry," Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was
thinking, "we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we
can do...."
"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry
345
quietly.
"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?" snapped Hermione.
"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not
supposed to be doing anything else!"
"All right!"
The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures
across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --
"There goes Lupin," Hermione whispered. "He's transforming
"Hermione!" said Harry suddenly. "We've got to move!"
"We mustn't, I keep telling you --"
"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!"
Hermione gasped.
"Quick!" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. "Quick! Where are we
going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming
any moment --"
"Back to Hagrid's!" Harry said. "It's empty now -- come on!"
They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them....
The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and
Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after
them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.
"Shh, Fang, it's us!" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his
ears to quieten him. "That was really close!" she said to Harry.
"Yeah..."
Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was
346
going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back
inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his
wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.
"I think I'd better go outside again, you know," said Harry slowly. "I
can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --"
Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.
"I'm not going to try and interfere," said Harry quickly. "But if we
don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to
rescue Sirius?"
"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be
careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors
Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear
yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on
Sirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment....
Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in
his chest.... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any
moment....
For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's
door. You must not be seen. But he didn't want to be seen. He wanted to
do the seeing.... He had to know...
And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness
from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake.... They were
moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.... He wouldn't
have to get near them....
Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father...
If it was him... if it really was him... he had to know, had to find
out....
The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody.
On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his own
attempts at a Patronus --
347
There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself
behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank,
the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified
excitement shot through him -- any moment now --
"Come on!" he muttered, staring about. "Where are you? Dad, come on --"
But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of
dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was
time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this
time --
And then it hit him -- he understood. He hadn't seen his father -- he
had seen himself --
Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
"EXPECTO PATRONUM! "he yelled.
And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but
a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to
see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away
from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head
and charge at the swarming dementors.... Now it was galloping around and
around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling
back, scattering, retreating into the darkness.... They were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It
was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming
back to him....
It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it
stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its
antlered head. And Harry realized... "Prongs, "he whispered.
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it
vanished.
348
Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of
his heart, he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw
Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.
"What did you do?" she said fiercely. "You said you were only going to
keep a lookout!"
"I just saved all our lives...," said Harry. "Get behind here -- behind
this bush -- I'll explain."
Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet
again.
"Did anyone see you?"
"Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad!
It's okay!"
"Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove
away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew I
could do it this time," said Harry, "because I'd already done it....
Does that make sense?"
"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!"
Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had
regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp
forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no
doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out
in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.
"Right, it's nearly time," said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch.
"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to
the hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward
before anybody realizes we're missing.... 11
They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the
bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was
ferreting for worms again.
349
"D' you reckon he's up there yet?" said Harry, checking his watch. He
looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of
the West Tower.
"Look!" Hermione whispered. "\Who's that? Someone's coming back out of
the castle!"
Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the
grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his
belt.
"Macnair!" said Harry. "The executioner! He's gone to get the dementors!
This is it, Hermione --"
Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave her a leg up.
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and
climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak's rope back over his neck
and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.
"Ready?" he whispered to Hermione. "YotM better hold on to me --
He nudged Buckbeak's sides with his heels.
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks
with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.
Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear
her muttering, "Oh, no -- I don't like this oh, I really don't like this
--"
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper
floors of the castle.... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the
rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows
flashing past --
"Whoa!" he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the
hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.
350
"He's there!" Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the
window. He reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tap
sharply on the glass.
Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair,
hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.
"Stand back!" Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still
gripping the back of Harry's robes with her left hand.
"Alohomora!"
The window sprang open.
"How -- how --?" said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff
"Get on -- there's not much time," said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly
on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. "You've got to get
out of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair's gone to get them."
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his
head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In
seconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak's back and pull
himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.
"Okay, Buckbeak, up!" said Harry, shaking the rope. "Up to the tower --
come on.
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
"Sirius, you'd better go, quick," Harry panted. "They'll reach
Flitwick's office any moment, they'll find out you're gone."
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
"What happened to the other boy? Ron?" croaked Sirius.
"He's going to be okay. He's still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says
351
she'll be able to make him better. Quick -- go --"
But Black was still staring down at Harry.
"How can I ever thank --"
"GO!" Harry and Hermione shouted together.
Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.
"We'll see each other again," he said. "You are -- truly your father's
son, Harry...."
He squeezed Buckbeak's sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped
back as the enormous wings rose once more.... The hippogriff took off
into the air.... He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry
gazed after them... then a cloud drifted across the moon.... They were
gone.
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
OWL POST AGAIN
Harry!"
Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. "We've got
exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without
anybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --"
"Okay," said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, "let's go...."
They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly
spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heard
voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It
sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the
corridor at the foot of the staircase.
"... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties," Snape was
saying. "The Kiss will be performed immediately?"
352
"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair
has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking
forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last.... I
daresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry's
back in his right mind, I expect he'll want to tell the Prophet exactly
how you saved him...."
Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he and
Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place. Their footsteps died
away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd really
gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase,
then another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.
"Peeves!" Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione's wrist. "In here!"
They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves
seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits,
laughing his head off.
"Oh, he's horrible," whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. "I bet
he's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off
Sirius...." She checked her watch. "Three minutes, Harry!"
They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance,
then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.
"Hermione -- what'll happen -- if we don't get back inside before
Dumbledore locks the door?" Harry panted.
I don't want to think about it!" Hermione moaned, checking her watch
again. "One minute!"
They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing
entrance. "Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore," said Hermione tensely. "Come
on, Harry!"
They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore's back
appeared.
"I am going to lock you in," they heard him saying. "it is five minutes
353
to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck."
Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his
wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward.
Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver
mustache. "Well?" he said quietly.
"We did it!" said Harry breathlessly. "Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak...."
Dumbledore beamed at them.
"Well done. I think --" He listened intently for any sound within the
hospital wing. "Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lock
you in --"
Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty
except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the
lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own
beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment
later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.
"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my
patients now?"
She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept
their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they
ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting,
listening, their nerves jangling.... And then, as they both took a
fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar
of fury echoing from somewhere above them....
"What was that?" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.
Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam
Pomfrey was staring at the door.
"Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?"
Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing
nearer --
354
"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the
room with him. When this gets out --"
"HE DIDN'T DISAPPARATE!" Snape roared, now very close at hand. "YOU
CAN'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS -- HAS
--
SOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTER!"
"Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --"
BAM.
The door of the hospital wing burst open.
Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore
alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying
himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.
"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!" he bellowed. "WHAT DID YOU DO?"
"Professor Snape!" shrieked Madam Pomfrey. "Control yourself!"
"See here, Snape, be reasonable," said Fudge. "This door's been locked,
we just saw --"
"THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!" Snape howled, pointing at Harry
and
Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
"Calm down, man!" Fudge barked. "You're talking nonsense!"
"YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!" shrieked Snape. "HE DID IT, I KNOW HE
DID IT
--"
"That will do, Severus," said Dumbledore quietly. "Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes
ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?"
355
"Of course not!" said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. "I would have heard
them!"
"Well, there you have it, Severus," said Dumbledore calmly. "Unless you
are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at
once, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further."
Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly
shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind
his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed
out of the ward.
"Fellow seems quite unbalanced," said Fudge, staring after him. "I'd
watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore."
"Oh, he's not unbalanced," said Dumbledore quietly. "He's just suffered
a severe disappointment."
"He's not the only one!" puffed Fudge. "The Daily Prophet's going to
have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our
fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that
hippogriff's escape to get out, and I'll be a laughingstock! Well... I'd
better go and notify the Ministry.....
"And the dementors?" said Dumbledore. "They'll be removed from the
school, I trust?"
"Oh yes, they'll have to go," said Fudge, running his fingers
distractedly through his hair. "Never dreamed they'd attempt to
administer the Kiss on an innocent boy... Completely out of control...
no, I'll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight.... Perhaps we
should think about dragons at the school entrance...."
"Hagrid would like that," said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and
Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to
the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed
back to her office.
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up.
356
They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.
"What -- what happened?" he groaned. "Harry? Why are we in here? Where's
Sirius? Where's Lupin? What's going on?"
Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
"You explain," said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next
day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and
the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of
another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going,
however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking
about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where
Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant
squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread
of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag
had galloped toward him from there just last night....
A shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very bleary-eyed
Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized
handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.
"Know I shouldn' feel happy, after wha' happened las' night," he said.
"I mean, Black escapin' again, an, everythin' -- but guess what?"
"What?" they said, pretending to look curious.
"Beaky! He escaped! He's free! Bin celebratin' all night!"
"That's wonderful!" said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because
he looked as though he was close to laughing.
"Yeah... can't've tied him up properly," said Hagrid, gazing happily out
over the grounds. "I was worried this mornin', mind... thought he mighta
met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin'
las' night...."
"What?" said Harry quickly.
357
"Blimey, haven' yeh heard?" said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. He
lowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight. "Er -- Snape
told all the Slytherins this mornin'.... Thought everyone'd know by
now... Professor Lupin's a werewolf, see. An' he was loose on the
grounds las' night.... He's packin' now, o' course.
"He's packing?" said Harry, alarmed. "Why?"
"Leavin', isn' he?" said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to
ask. "Resigned firs' thing this mornin'. Says he can't risk it happenin
again.
Harry scrambled to his feet.
"I'm going to see him," he said to Ron and Hermione.
"But if he's resigned --"
"-- doesn't sound like there's anything we can do --"
"I don't care. I still want to see him. I'll meet you back here."
Lupin's office door was open. He had already packed most of his things.
The grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase,
which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his
desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.
"I saw you coming," said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he
had been poring over. It was the Marauder's Map.
"I just saw Hagrid," said Harry. "And he said you'd resigned. It's not
true, is it?"
"I'm afraid it is," said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and
taking out the contents.
"Why?" said Harry. "The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping
Sirius, do they?"
358
Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.
"No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to
save your lives." He sighed. "That was the final straw for Severus. I
think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he -- er --
accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast."
"You're not leaving just because of that!" said Harry.
Lupin smiled wryly.
"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.... They
will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last
night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you.... That must
never happen again."
"You're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we've ever had!"
said Harry. "Don't go!"
Lupin shook his head and didn't speak. He carried on emptying his
drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to
make him stay, Lupin said, "From what the headmaster told me this
morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. if I'm proud of
anything I've done this year, it's how much you've learned.... Tell me
about your Patronus."
"How d'you know about that?" said Harry, distracted.
"What else could have driven the dementors back?"
Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he'd finished, Lupin was
smiling again.
"Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed," he said. "You
guessed right... that's why we called him Prongs."
Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers,
and turned to look at Harry.
"Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night," he said,
359
handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. "And..." He hesitated, then
held out the Marauder's Map too. "I am no longer your teacher, so I
don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It's no use to me,
and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it."
Harry took the map and grinned.
"You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would've wanted to
lure me out of school... you said they'd have thought it was funny."
"And so we would have," said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case.
"I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly
disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out
of the castle."
There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder's Map
and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket.
It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn't look surprised to see Harry
there.
"Your carriage is at the gates, Remus," he said.
"Thank You, Headmaster."
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank.
"Well -- good-bye, Harry," he said, smiling. "It has been a real
pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage...."
Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as
possible.
"Good-bye, then, Remus," said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the
grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands.
Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the
office.
Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He
360
heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there.
"Why so miserable, Harry?" he said quietly. "You should be very proud of
yourself after last night."
"It didn't make any difference," said Harry bitterly. "Pettigrew got
away."
"Didn't make any difference?" said Dumbledore quietly, "It made all the
difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved
an innocent man from a terrible fate."
Terrible. Something stirred in Harry's memory. Greater and more terrible
than ever before... Professor Trelawney's prediction!
"Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination
exam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange."
"Indeed?" said Dumbledore. "Er -- stranger than usual, you mean?"
"Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she
said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him before
midnight.... She said the servant would help him come back to power."
Harry stared up at Dumbledore. "And then she sort of became normal
again, and she couldn't remember anything she'd said. Was it -- was she
making a real prediction?"
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.
"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been." he said thoughtfully.
"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to
two. I should offer her a pay raise...."
"But --" Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so
calmly?
"But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew!
That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!"
"It does not," said Dumbledore quietly. "Hasn't your experience with the
361
Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions
are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a
very difficult business indeed.... Professor Trelawney, bless her, is
living proof of that.... You did a very noble thing, in saving
Pettigrew's life."
"But if he helps Voldemort back to power
"Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is
in your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates
a certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants
his servant in the debt of Harry Potter."
"I don't want a connection with Pettigrew!" said Harry. "He betrayed my
parents!"
"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust
me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's
life."
Harry couldn't imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though
he knew what Harry was thinking.
"I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry," he
said gently. "He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it."
Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn't laugh -- he could tell
Dumbledore...
"I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw
myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him." "An easy mistake
to make," said Dumbledore softly. "I expect you'll tire of hearing it,
but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... you
have your mother's eyes.
Harry shook his head.
"It was stupid, thinking it was him," he muttered. "I mean, I knew he
was dead."
362
"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we
don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your
father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you
have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus?
Prongs rode again last night."
It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.
Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi," said
Dumbledore, smiling. "An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keeping
it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your
Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match
against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father
last night.... You found him inside yourself."
And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused
thoughts.
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night
that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry
heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none
of them came close to the truth.
Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had
found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged
that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy
Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius's escape.
"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I'll have a lot of proposals to
make about Magical Law Enforcement!" he told the only person who would
listen -- his girlfriend, Penelope.
Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so
cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in
helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a
school year in worse spirits.
He certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin
363
go. The whole of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was
miserable about his resignation.
"Wonder what they'll give us next year?" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.
"Maybe a vampire," suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.
It wasn't only Professor Lupin's departure that was weighing on Harry's
mind. He couldn't help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney's
prediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had
sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering
Harry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the
Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed
he would be living with Sirius from now on... his parents' best
friend.... It would have been the next best thing to having his own
father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news,
because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn't
help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had,
and the fact that it was now impossible.
The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had got
through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have
stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape's behavior toward
Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn't have
thought it possible that Snape's dislike for him could increase, but it
certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape's
thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing
his fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry's throat.
Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a
handful of O.W.L.s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to
their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House
championship for the third year running. This meant that the end of term
feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the
Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated.
Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the
next day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng,
364
Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.
"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast.
I've decided to drop Muggle Studies."
"But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!" said
Ron.
"I know," sighed Hermione, "but I can't stand another year like this
one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I've handed it in. Without
Muggle Studies and Divination, I'll be able to have a normal schedule
again."
I still can't believe you didn't tell us about it," said Ron grumpily.
"We're supposed to be your friends."
"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone," said Hermione severely. She looked
around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a
mountain. Two whole months before he'd see it again....
"Oh, cheer up, Harry!" said Hermione sadly.
"I'm okay," said Harry quickly. "Just thinking about the holidays."
"Yeah, I've been thinking about them too," said Ron. "Harry, you've got
to come and stay with us. I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'll
call you. I know how to use a fellytone now --"
"A telephone, Ron," said Hermione. "Honestly, you should take Muggle
Studies next year...."
Ron *ignored her.
"It's the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and
stay, and we'll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work."
This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.
"Yeah... I bet the Dursleys'd be pleased to let me come... especially
after what I did to Aunt Marge...."
365
Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in
several games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart
arrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing with
chocolate in it.
But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly
happy turned up....
"Harry," said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. "What's that
thing outside your window?"
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and
saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for
it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the
air, buffeted this way and that in the train's slipstream. Harry quickly
pulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt
like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside. The owl
dropped its letter onto Harry's seat and began zooming around their
compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its
task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.
Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow
eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm's way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, "It's from Sirius!"
"What?" said Ron and Hermione excitedly. "Read it aloud!"
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know
whether they're used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl
falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a
366
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse
me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle
will be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt --
"Ha!" said Hermione triumphantly. "See! I told you it was from him!"
"Yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?" said Ron. "Ouch!" The tiny owl,
now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what
it seemed to think was an affectionate way.
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name
but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please
consider it as thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from your
godfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle's house. I had only hoped to
get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the
sight of me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next
year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I'll write again soon.
Sirius
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm
and contented as though he'd swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one
gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
367
"That'll be good enough for Dumbledore!" said Harry happily. He looked
back at Sirius's letter. "Hang on, there's a RS...."
I thought your ftiend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron's eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. "Keep
him?" he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment;
then, to Harry's and Hermione's great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
"What do you reckon?" Ron asked the cat. "Definitely an owl?"
Crookshanks purred.
"That's good enough for me," said Ron happily. "He's mine."
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into
King's Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he,
Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an ('
three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a
good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and
when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about
them seemed confirmed.
"I'll call about the World Cup!" Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig's cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
"What's that?" he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still
clutching in his hand. "If it's another form for me to sign, you've got
another ---"
"It's not," said Harry cheerfully. "It's a letter from my godfather."
"Godfather?" sputtered Uncle Vernon. "You haven't got a godfather!"
"Yes, I have," said Harry brightly. "He was my mum and dad's best
friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison
and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep
368
up with my news... check if I'm happy..."
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face,
Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of
him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.

he hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and 
a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet 
Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and 
lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use 
of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual 
car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet 
Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows 
thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The 
only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his 
back in a flower bed outside number four. 
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the 
pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a 
short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy 
and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the up-
pers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors, 
who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be pun-
ishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea 
bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only 
T 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 2  
way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia 
stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight 
down into the flower bed below. 
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his 
idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on 
the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at 
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or 
shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had 
tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his 
aunt and uncle. 
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open win-
dow, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the 
boy’s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?” 
“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not in the 
house.” 
Uncle Vernon grunted. 
“Watching the news . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what 
he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dud-
ley hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime 
Minister is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about his lot on 
our news —” 
“Vernon, shh!” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s open!” 
“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .” 
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N 
Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving 
old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was 
frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was 
concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking 
him around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had 
rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s 
voice floated out of the window again. 
 
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 3  
“Dudders out for tea?” 
“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many lit-
tle friends, he’s so popular . . .” 
Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were as-
tonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his 
dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang 
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that 
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every 
evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and 
throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at 
it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent 
most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers 
from bins along the way. 
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock 
news reached Harry’s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps 
tonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night — 
“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the 
Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week —” 
“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the 
end of the newsreader’s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower 
bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, 
it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and de-
struction were more important than stranded holidaymakers. . . . 
He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. 
Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expecta-
tion, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and 
always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why noth-
ing had happened yet. . . . 
He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not rec-
ognized for what it really was by the Muggles — an unexplained 
disappearance,   perhaps,   or   some   strange   accident . . . but   the  
 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 4  
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the drought in the 
Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, 
“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter 
that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s di-
vorce from her famous husband (“as if we’re interested in their sordid 
affairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively 
in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on). 
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the 
newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel 
way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feath-
ers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find 
out more. . . .” 
Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing 
budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cau-
tiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows, 
preparing to crawl out from under the window. 
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in 
very quick succession. 
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat 
streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a 
bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Durs-
leys’ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this 
signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waist-
band of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a 
sword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of 
his head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant 
crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder. 
Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he 
swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise, 
but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple 
hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around 
his throat. 
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 5  
“Put — it — away!” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s ear. “Now! 
Before — anyone — sees!” 
“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they strug-
gled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage-like fingers with his left 
hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as 
the pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Un-
cle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an 
electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through 
his nephew, making him impossible to hold. 
Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened 
up, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud 
cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various 
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans 
and tried to look innocent. 
“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number 
Seven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. “Did you hear 
that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!” 
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious 
neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin 
became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him. 
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the 
point at which Uncle Vernon’s outstretched hands could resume their 
strangling. 
“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle Vernon in a 
croaky voice that trembled with fury. 
“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept looking left 
and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made 
the cracking noise. 
“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our —” 
“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly. 
Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Ver-
non’s wide, purple one. She looked livid. 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 6  
“Why were you lurking under our window?” 
“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our 
window, boy?” 
“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned voice. 
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. 
“Listening to the news! Again?” 
“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry. 
“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re re-
ally up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news 
tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot . . .” 
“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon low-
ered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, “. . . that your lot 
don’t get on our news!” 
“That’s all you know,” said Harry. 
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia 
said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are all those —” she too lowered 
her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, “— owls — 
doing if they’re not bringing you news?” 
“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that 
one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those pesti-
lential birds!” 
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the 
truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly 
know how bad Harry felt at admitting it. 
“The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly. 
“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once. 
“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 
“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia. 
“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon. 
“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before 
the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the  
 
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 7  
front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up 
the street. 
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his 
aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not 
care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing mat-
ters on his mind. 
Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone 
Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the 
house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that 
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right 
at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and 
stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely de-
serted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to 
become invisible. . . . 
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had 
pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his fa-
vorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his 
shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt 
Petunias dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to 
him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now? 
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked 
away. 
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so 
desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he 
belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. 
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of something breaking in-
side a neighbor’s house? 
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he 
knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer 
rolled over him once again. . . . 
Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five  
 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 8  
o’clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily 
Prophet — but was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry 
merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; 
when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was 
back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry 
cared about. 
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his 
best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had 
that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed. 
“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously. . . .” “We’ve been 
told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. . . .” 
“We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here. . . .” “There’s a fair 
amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you. . . .” 
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too both-
ered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, “I expect we’ll be see-
ing you quite soon” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As 
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione 
and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house. 
He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the 
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry at 
them that he had thrown both their birthday presents of Honeydukes 
chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating 
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night. 
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he, 
Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself capable of handling much 
more than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it 
been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being 
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed . . . ? 
Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth 
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the grave-
yard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments 
too. 
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 9  
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he 
passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had 
first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to under-
stand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty 
of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at least they contained 
words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints: 
“I know this must be frustrating for you. . . .” “Keep your nose clean 
and everything will be okay. . . .” “Be careful and don’t do anything 
rash. . . .” 
Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into 
Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had 
(by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temp-
tation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow 
by himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good 
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet 
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hear-
ing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. 
Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man 
who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, 
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the 
first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . . 
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the 
parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. 
When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley 
and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around 
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to 
hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to 
think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he 
had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, 
because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unset-
tling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and 
locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 10  
trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his 
forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that 
Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any-
more. . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was 
getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would 
probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be ex-
pected. . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . . 
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell 
with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known 
Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whing-
ing for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, 
reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear 
about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgot-
ten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without 
inviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure 
Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the tempta-
tion to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Volde-
mort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s 
head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell 
around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only 
sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park 
railings. 
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the 
sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The street-
lamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong 
enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the 
park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were 
laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing 
bikes that they were wheeling along. 
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmis-
takably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accom-
panied by his faithful gang. 
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 11  
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the discov-
ery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As 
Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had 
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Cham-
pion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it, 
had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry 
in the primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s first 
punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore 
but he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and 
more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all 
around were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of 
“that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooli-
gan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys. 
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered 
whom they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found 
himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I’m 
sitting here all alone. . . . Come and have ago. . . . 
If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to 
make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He 
wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of 
provoking Harry. . . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s 
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond 
. . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he 
had his wand . . . let them try . . . He’d love to vent some of his frus-
tration on the boys who had once made his life hell — 
But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were al-
most at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them. 
. . . Seeking a fight was not a smart move. . . . He must not use 
magic. . . . He would be risking expulsion again. . . . 
Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along 
Magnolia Road. 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 12  
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my 
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done . . . 
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon 
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to 
be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had 
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley 
again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park 
gate. 
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses 
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners 
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred 
Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches 
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing 
disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he 
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along 
Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying 
their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped 
into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited. 
“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws 
from the others. 
“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers. 
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley. 
“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon. 
“See you then,” said Dudley. 
“Bye Dud!” 
“See ya, Big D!” 
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off 
again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the 
corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon 
came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his 
ease, humming tunelessly. 
“Hey, Big D!” 
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 13  
Dudley turned. 
“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.” 
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry. 
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again. 
“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his 
cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.” 
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled 
into fists. 
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?” 
“Shut your face.” 
“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and 
‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?” 
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting 
Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control. 
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin 
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights 
ago —” 
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley. 
“Oh yeah?” 
“He cheeked me.” 
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on 
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .” 
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous 
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as 
though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the 
only outlet he had. 
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had 
first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia 
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the 
streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps 
were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on 
the other. 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 14  
“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley 
said after a few seconds. 
“What thing?” 
“That — that thing you’re hiding.” 
Harry grinned again. 
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were, 
you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time. . . .” 
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it. 
“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not. 
You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.” 
“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?” 
“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely 
convinced. Harry laughed softly. 
“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have 
you?” Dudley snarled. 
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat 
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on 
about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?” 
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was 
out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was 
twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing 
out —” 
“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ fright-
ened of nasty Harry’s wand?” 
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley. 
“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all 
dark like this.” 
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled. 
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin. 
From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a 
strangely triumphant look. 
“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely 
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 15  
nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or 
something?” 
“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your 
sleep. Moaning.” 
“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was a cold, plung-
ing sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night 
in his dreams. 
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched, 
whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s 
Cedric — your boyfriend?” 
“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had 
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know 
about Cedric? 
“ ‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!’ ” 
“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!” 
“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed 
Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ Don’t you point that thing at 
me!” 
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand di-
rectly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of 
Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, 
to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect, 
struck dumb, sprouting feelers — 
“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you under-
stand me?” 
“Point that thing somewhere else!” 
“I said, do you understand me?” 
“Point it somewhere else!” 
“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?” 
“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —” 
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been 
doused in icy water. 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 16  
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky 
was suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the 
misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant 
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening 
was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total, 
impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had 
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them. 
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without 
meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he 
could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have 
the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that, 
trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a 
weightless veil. 
Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear. 
“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!” 
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!” 
“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —” 
“I said shut up!” 
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The 
cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had 
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were stand-
ing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly 
around, unseeing . . . 
It was impossible. . . . They couldn’t be here. . . . Not in Little 
Whinging . . . He strained his ears. . . . He would hear them before 
he saw them. . . . 
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? What are 
you d-do — ?” 
“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —” 
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been 
dreading. 
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some-
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 17  
thing that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a hor-
rible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air. 
“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I will!” 
“Dudley, shut —” 
WHAM! 
A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off 
his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry’s eyes; for the sec-
ond time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in 
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand 
had flown out of his hand. 
“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as 
he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in 
the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley 
fence, stumbling. 
“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT 
IT!” 
There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps 
stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him 
that could mean only one thing. There was more than one. 
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU 
DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered franti-
cally, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand 
— come on — Lumos!” 
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in 
his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his 
right hand — the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scram-
bled to his feet, and turned around. 
His stomach turned over. 
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, 
hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, 
sucking on the night as it came. 
Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand. 
CHAPTER  ONE 
 18  
“Expecto Patronum!” 
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the de-
mentor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his 
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, 
panic fogging his brain — concentrate — 
A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s 
robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears. 
“Expecto Patronum!” 
His voice sounded dim and distant. . . . Another wisp of silver 
smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do 
it anymore, he couldn’t work the spell — 
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laugh-
ter. . . . He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, fill-
ing his own lungs, drowning him — Think . . . something happy. . . . 
But there was no happiness in him. . . . The dementor’s icy fingers 
were closing on his throat — the high-pitched laughter was growing 
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death, 
Harry. . . . It might even be painless. . . . I would not know. . . . I have 
never died. . . .” 
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again — 
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for 
breath — 
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” 
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its 
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have 
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag 
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated. 
“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he 
sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY? 
DUDLEY!” 
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley 
was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second de-
DUDLEY  DEMENTED 
 19  
mentor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy 
hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded 
head toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him. . . . 
“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the 
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The de-
mentor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver 
antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its 
fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag 
cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist. 
Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze 
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mun-
dane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry 
stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to 
normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was stick-
ing to him; he was drenched in sweat. 
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in 
Little Whinging . . . 
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. 
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but 
then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising 
his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer. 
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her 
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string 
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway 
out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hur-
riedly out of sight, but — 
“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are 
more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!”

hat?” said Harry blankly. 
“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to see 
someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom! 
I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It’s 
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to 
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble 
this is going to cause! I will kill him!” 
“But —” 
The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what 
dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of 
them down the alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?” 
“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was 
I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely 
without cover when I warned him —” 
“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on — it 
was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!” 
“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies under a car just 
in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and warned me, but by the time I got 
W

to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore go-
ing to say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor. 
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!” 
“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her. 
“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know Dumbledore? 
But come on — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much 
as Transfigured a teabag —” 
She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive arms in her wiz-
ened hands, and tugged. 
“Get up, you useless lump, get up!” 
But Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on 
the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight. 
“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With an 
enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley 
seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in 
their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go 
of him he swayed dangerously. 
“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically. 
Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around his own shoul-
ders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his 
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously 
around the corner. 
“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria 
Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there’s going to be hell 
to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk 
about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery . . . This was 
exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — what’s that at the end of the 
street? Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice. . . . Don’t put your wand away, boy, 
don’t I keep telling you I’m no use?” 
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at the 
same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but 
Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 22  
was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the 
ground. 
“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked Mrs. Figg, 
panting with the effort to keep walking. “All those times I came round 
your house — why didn’t you say anything?” 
“Dumbledore’s orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say any-
thing, you were too young. I’m sorry I gave you such a miserable time, 
but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they’d thought you 
enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know. . . . But oh my word,” she said 
tragically, wringing her hands once more, “when Dumbledore hears 
about this — how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be 
on duty until midnight — where is he? How am I going to tell Dum-
bledore what’s happened, I can’t Apparate —” 
“I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” Harry groaned, wondering 
whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley’s weight. 
“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as 
quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting un-
derage magic, they’ll know already, you mark my words —” 
“But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic — they’re 
going to be more worried what dementors were doing floating around 
Wisteria Walk, surely?” 
“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — MUNDUNGUS 
FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!” 
There was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled drink and 
stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered over-
coat materialized right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long 
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the dole-
ful look of a basset hound; he was also clutching a silvery bundle that 
Harry recognized at once as an Invisibility Cloak. 
“ ’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dud-
ley. “What ’appened to staying undercover?” 
 
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 23  
“I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “Dementors, you useless, 
skiving sneak thief!” 
“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. “Dementors here?” 
“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” shrieked 
Mrs. Figg. “Dementors attacking the boy on your watch!” 
“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to 
Harry and back again. “Blimey, I . . .” 
“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you not to go? 
Didn’t I?” 
“I — well, I —” Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. “It . . . 
it was a very good business opportunity, see . . .” 
Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and 
whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by 
the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food. 
“Ouch — gerroff — gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone’s gotta tell 
Dumbledore!” 
“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of 
cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. “And — it — 
had — better — be — you — and — you — can — tell — him — 
why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!” 
“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head, 
cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!” 
And with another loud crack, he vanished. 
“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously. “Now 
come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?” 
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out 
that he could barely walk under Dudley’s bulk. He gave the semicon-
scious Dudley a heave and staggered onward. 
“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet 
Drive. “Just in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word, 
what a catastrophe . . . and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and  
 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 24  
Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs. 
. . . Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the 
cat’s among the pixies now . . .” 
“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore’s . . . been having . . . me 
followed?” 
“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently. “Did you expect 
him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in 
June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. . . . Right 
. . . get inside and stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I 
expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.” 
“What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly. 
“I’m going straight home,” said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark 
street and shuddering. “I’ll need to wait for more instructions. Just 
stay in the house. Good night.” 
“Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know —” 
But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, 
string bag clanking. 
“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he had a million questions to ask 
anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds 
Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted 
Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number 
four’s garden path. 
The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waist-
band of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline 
grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the 
front door. 
“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — Diddy, 
what’s the matter?” 
Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his 
arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face 
pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the 
doormat. 
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 25  
“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!” 
Harry’s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mus-
tache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated. 
He hurried forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed 
Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick. 
“He’s ill, Vernon!” 
“What is it, son? What’s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you 
something foreign for tea?” 
“Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on 
the ground?” 
“Hang on — you haven’t been mugged, have you, son?” 
Aunt Petunia screamed. 
“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak 
to Mummy! What did they do to you?” 
In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which 
suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Ver-
non slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy 
progress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and 
quietly toward the stairs. 
“Who did it, son? Give us names. We’ll get them, don’t worry.” 
“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell 
Mummy!” 
Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his 
voice. 
“Him.” 
Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the 
explosion. 
“BOY! COME HERE!” 
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot 
slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys. 
The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the 
darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he

 26  
was still very green and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing 
in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, nar-
rowed eyes. 
“What have you done to my son?” he said in a menacing growl. 
“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon 
wouldn’t believe him. 
“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Aunt Petunia said in a quavering 
voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley’s leather jacket. 
“Was it — was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use — his thing?” 
Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded. 
“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and 
Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t 
me, it was —” 
But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the 
kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it 
soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it 
was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips 
of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside 
again and off across the garden. 
“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his tem-
ple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. “OWLS 
AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY 
HOUSE!” 
But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out 
the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his 
Adam’s apple. 
 
Dear Mr. Potter, 
We have received intelligence that you performed the Pa-
tronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening 
in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle. 
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reason-

able Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your ex-
pulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of resi-
dence shortly to destroy your wand. 
As you have already received an official warning for a 
previous offense under section 13 of the International Con-
federation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform 
you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at 
the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on August 12th. 
Hoping you are well, 
Yours sincerely,

Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware of 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his 
head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his conscious-
ness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all 
over. He was never going back. 
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, 
shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dud-
ley, who was retching again. 
Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry 
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy 
your wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run — 
now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain 
of one thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an 
almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the 
kitchen. 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 28  
“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When 
Harry didn’t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the door-
way into the hall. “I haven’t finished with you, boy!” 
“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly. 
“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —” 
“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” said Harry, 
raising the wand. 
“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle Vernon. “I know 
you’re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!” 
“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So I can do 
whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. One — two —” 
A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed, 
Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night 
Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made. He 
spotted it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting 
outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed 
window. 
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed 
the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl 
stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its 
feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter. 
Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was writ-
ten very hastily and blotchily in black ink. 
 
Harry — 
Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s trying to 
sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND 
UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC. 
DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND. 
 
 
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 29  
Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out. . . . What did that mean? 
How much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of 
Magic? Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hog-
warts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost 
immediately strangled by panic — how was he supposed to refuse to 
surrender his wand without doing magic? He’d have to duel with the 
Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to escape 
Azkaban, let alone expulsion. 
His mind was racing. . . . He could run for it and risk being cap-
tured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here. 
He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that 
Mr. Weasley had his best interests at heart . . . and, after all, Dumble-
dore had sorted out much worse than this before. . . . 
“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying.” 
He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and 
Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt 
change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. 
The vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing worse than 
ever. 
“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled. 
“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said 
Harry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case 
the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and 
quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than to have him start rag-
ing and bellowing. “The second one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he 
works at the Ministry.” 
“Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People like you in 
government? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the 
country’s going to the dogs. . . .” 
When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then 
spat, “And why have you been expelled?” 
 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 30  
“Because I did magic.” 
“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on the top of 
the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley’s low-fat snacks top-
pled out and burst on the floor. “So you admit it! What did you do to 
Dudley?” 
“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly less calmly. “That wasn’t me —” 
“Was,” muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and 
Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quiet him 
while they both bent low over Dudley. 
“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?” 
“Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia. 
“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled. 
“Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use —” Harry began angrily, but . . . 
“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison. 
“Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about 
furiously. 
“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. “Everything dark. 
And then I h-heard . . . things. Inside m-my head . . .” 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. 
If their least favorite thing in the world was magic, closely followed 
by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban, 
people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They ob-
viously thought Dudley was losing his mind. 
“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed Aunt Petu-
nia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes. 
But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and 
shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that 
had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain 
curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of 
their life. . . . What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have 
been forced to hear? 
“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in an unnatu-
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 31  
rally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a 
very ill person. 
“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then —” 
He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was re-
membering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happi-
ness were sucked out of you. 
“Horrible,” croaked Dudley. “Cold. Really cold.” 
“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt 
Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley’s forehead to feel his temper-
ature. “What happened then, Dudders?” 
“Felt . . . felt . . . felt . . . as if. . . as if . . .” 
“As if you’d never be happy again,” Harry supplied tonelessly. 
“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling. 
“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable 
volume as he straightened up. “So you put some crackpot spell on my 
son so he’d hear voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery, 
or something, did you?” 
“How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, temper and 
voice rising together. “It wasn’t me! It was a couple of dementors!” 
“A couple of— what’s this codswallop?” 
“De — men — tors,” said Harry slowly and clearly. “Two of 
them.” 
“And what the ruddy hell are dementors?” 
“They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,” said Aunt Petunia. 
Two seconds’ ringing silence followed these words and then Aunt 
Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a 
disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry’s 
brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing — but Aunt Petunia? 
“How d’you know that?” he asked her, astonished. 
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at 
Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to re-
veal her horsey teeth. 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 32  
“I heard — that awful boy — telling her about them — years ago,” 
she said jerkily. 
“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?” 
said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horri-
bly flustered. 
Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the 
course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry’s mother had 
been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was as-
tounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the 
magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into 
pretending it didn’t exist. 
Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once 
more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk, 
opened it for a third time and croaked, “So — so — they — er — 
they — er — they actually exist, do they — er — dementy-whatsits?” 
Aunt Petunia nodded. 
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if 
hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did, 
he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find 
more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which 
zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and 
landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the 
Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking en-
velope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped 
back out into the night. 
“Enough — effing — owls . . .” muttered Uncle Vernon distract-
edly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again. 
 
Dear Mr. Potter, 
Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes 
ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy 
your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your

 33  
disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at which time an official 
decision will be taken. 
Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed 
that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that 
time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from 
school pending further inquiries. 
With best wishes, 
Yours sincerely,

Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The 
miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he 
was not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means ban-
ished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of 
August. 
“Well?” said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings. 
“What now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have 
the death penalty?” he added as a hopeful afterthought. 
“I’ve got to go to a hearing,” said Harry. 
“And they’ll sentence you there?” 
“I suppose so.” 
“I won’t give up hope, then,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. 
“Well, if that’s all,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He was desperate 
to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione, or 
Sirius. 
“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle Vernon. 
“SIT BACK DOWN!” 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 34  
“What now?” said Harry impatiently. 
“DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon. “I want to know exactly what 
happened to my son!” 
“FINE!” yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot 
out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand. All three Durs-
leys flinched, looking terrified. 
“Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent 
and Wisteria Walk,” said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his 
temper. “Dudley thought he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my 
wand but didn’t use it. Then two dementors turned up —” 
“But what ARE dementoids?” asked Uncle Vernon furiously. 
“What do they DO?” 
“I told you — they suck all the happiness out of you,” said Harry, 
“and if they get the chance, they kiss you —” 
“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. “Kiss you?” 
“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.” 
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream. 
“His soul? They didn’t take — he’s still got his —” 
She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though test-
ing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him. 
“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had,” said 
Harry, exasperated. 
“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the 
appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a 
plane he understood. “Gave ’em the old one-two, did you?” 
“You can’t give a dementor the old one-two,” said Harry through 
clenched teeth. 
“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. “Why isn’t he 
all empty, then?” 
“Because I used the Patronus —” 
WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of 
dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace. 
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 35  
“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps 
of hair out of his mustache, something he hadn’t been driven to in a 
long time. “I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT 
TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!” 
But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl’s 
leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, 
explaining everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Min-
istry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything 
out — that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sir-
ius’s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls 
and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most re-
cent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius’s message. 
Arthur’s just told us what’s happened. 
Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do.  
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that 
had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, 
looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing there. 
And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t anybody going to say 
“well done” for fighting off two dementors single-handedly? Both Mr. 
Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and they 
were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much 
damage had been done. 
“— a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house 
and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t —” 
“I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, crushing Sirius’s let-
ter in his fist. 
“I want the truth about what happened tonight!” barked Uncle 
Vernon. “If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you’ve 
been expelled? You did you-know-what, you’ve admitted it!” 
Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 36  
ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, 
away from the Dursleys. 
“I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,” he said, 
forcing himself to remain calm. “It’s the only thing that works against 
them.” 
“But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?” said Uncle 
Vernon in tones of outrage. 
“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily. “No idea.” 
His head was pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now. His 
anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were 
all staring at him. 
“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “It’s got something to do 
with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else 
would they be down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the 
only —” Evidently he couldn’t bring himself to say the word “wizard.” 
“The only you-know-what for miles.” 
“I don’t know why they were here. . . .” 
But at these words of Uncle Vernon’s, Harry’s exhausted brain 
ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little 
Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the 
alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of 
Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and 
joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would? 
“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said Uncle Ver-
non, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train of thought. 
“Yes,” said Harry. 
If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the 
kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think. . . . 
“Oho! They were coming to arrest you!” said Uncle Vernon, with 
the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. 
“That’s it, isn’t it, boy? You’re on the run from the law!” 
 
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 37  
“Of course I’m not,” said Harry, shaking his head as though to 
scare off a fly, his mind racing now. 
“Then why — ?” 
“He must have sent them,” said Harry quietly, more to himself 
than to Uncle Vernon. 
“What’s that? Who must have sent them?” 
“Lord Voldemort,” said Harry. 
He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who 
flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,” 
“magic,” or “wand,” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all 
time without the slightest tremor. 
“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look 
of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name 
. . . that was the one who . . .” 
“Murdered my parents, yes,” Harry said. 
“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slight-
est sign that the murder of Harry’s parents might be a painful topic to 
anybody. “That giant bloke said so. He’s gone.” 
“He’s back,” said Harry heavily. 
It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia’s surgically 
clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen 
television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. 
The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have 
caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly 
non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry’s two 
lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned up-
side down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical 
world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soar-
ing around Little Whinging and he might never go back to Hogwarts. 
Harry’s head throbbed more painfully. 
“Back?” whispered Aunt Petunia. 
 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 38  
She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. 
And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully ap-
preciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother’s sister. He could not have 
said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew 
was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling 
of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had 
never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so 
unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were 
wide and fearful. The furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had main-
tained all Harry’s life — that there was no magic and no world other 
than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon — seemed to have 
fallen away. 
“Yes,” Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. “He came 
back a month ago. I saw him.” 
Her hands found Dudley’s massive leather-clad shoulders and 
clutched them. 
“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and 
back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented un-
derstanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. “Hang on. 
This Lord Voldything’s back, you say.” 
“Yes.” 
“The one who murdered your parents.” 
“Yes.” 
“And now he’s sending dismembers after you?” 
“Looks like it,” said Harry. 
“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to 
Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his 
great purple face stretching before Harry’s eyes. “Well, that settles it,” 
he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, “you can get out 
of this house, boy!” 
“What?” said Harry. 
“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt 
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 39  
Petunia and Dudley jumped. “OUT! OUT! I should’ve done it years 
ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half 
the lounge destroyed, Dudley’s tail, Marge bobbing around on the 
ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia — OUT! OUT! You’ve had it! 
You’re history! You’re not staying here if some loony’s after you, you’re 
not endangering my wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down 
on us, if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, I’ve had it! 
OUT!” 
Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, 
Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. Don’t leave the 
house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND 
UNCLE’S HOUSE. 
“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that 
his massive purple face came closer to Harry’s, so that Harry actually 
felt flecks of spit hit his face. “Get going! You were all keen to leave 
half an hour ago! I’m right behind you! Get out and never darken our 
doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place I don’t know. 
Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too 
damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, 
thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been rotten from the 
beginning, and I’ve had enough — OWLS!” 
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the 
floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry 
raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but 
it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let 
out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the 
red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight up the chimney 
again. 
Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat 
him to it. 
“You can open it if you like,” said Harry, “but I’ll hear what it says 
anyway. That’s a Howler.” 
CHAPTER  TWO 
 40  
“Let go of it, Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “Don’t touch it, it 
could be dangerous!” 
“It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. “It’s 
addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, 
Number Four, Privet Drive —” 
She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to 
smoke. 
“Open it!” Harry urged her. “Get it over with! It’ll happen 
anyway —” 
“No —” 
Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the 
kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late — the en-
velope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it. 
An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, is-
suing from the burning letter on the table. 
 
“REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.” 
 
Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the 
chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the enve-
lope smoldered into ash in the silence. 
“What is this?” Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. “What — I don’t — 
Petunia?” 
Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his 
mother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiraled horribly. Harry 
was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to 
burst. 
“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P-Petunia?” 
She raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed. 
“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she said weakly. 
“W-what?” 
 
A  PECK  OF  OWLS 
 41  
“He stays,” she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her 
feet again. 
“He . . . but Petunia . . .” 
“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,” she said. She was re-
gaining her usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though she was still 
very pale. “They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know where 
he’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.” 
Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire. 
“But Petunia, dear —” 
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry. 
“You’re to stay in your room,” she said. “You’re not to leave the 
house. Now get to bed.” 
Harry didn’t move. 
“Who was that Howler from?” 
“Don’t ask questions,” Aunt Petunia snapped. 
“Are you in touch with wizards?” 
“I told you to get to bed!” 
“What did it mean? Remember the last what?” 
“Go to bed!” 
“How come — ?” 
“YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GET TO BED!”

’ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from 
Hogwarts. I want to know what’s going on and when I’m going to get 
out of here. 
Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment 
the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed 
the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His 
owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. 
Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head 
pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and 
itched with tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley home, 
and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit 
him were throbbing painfully. 
Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, 
grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at 
the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Demen-
tors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him 
in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Min-
istry of Magic — and still no one was telling him what was going on.

THE  ADVANCED  GUARD

And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had 
echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen? 
Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was 
everyone treating him like some naughty kid? Don’t do any more 
magic, stay in the house. . . . 
He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his 
anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with 
in addition to the pain in the rest of his body. 
Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with 
a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost. 
“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her 
cage. “You can put that down, I’ve got work for you!” 
Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over 
the dead frog clamped in her beak. 
“Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parch-
ment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take 
these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here 
without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve written 
decent-length answers if you’ve got to. Understand?” 
Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog. 
“Get going, then,” said Harry. 
She took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, Harry threw 
himself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark 
ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty 
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at 
number four, Privet Drive. But he’d make it up to her when she came 
back with Sirius’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers. 
They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ig-
nore a dementor attack. He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat 
letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the 
Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling 
all further thought. 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 44  
 
           
But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his 
bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day 
Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle 
Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her 
approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might 
as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. 
Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn’t 
see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would 
achieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry he’d perform 
more illegal magic. 
So it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled alternately with 
restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during 
which he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them 
for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete 
that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into 
space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing. 
What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his 
wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? 
He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now 
that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged. 
. . . Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house, 
as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee 
from the Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone, 
given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he 
went next be decided for him; had his breach of the International 
Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azka-
ban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his 
bed and began pacing again. 
On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry was lying in 
one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind 
THE  ADVANCED  GUARD 
 45  
quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked 
slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an 
expression of enormous smugness. 
“We’re going out,” he said. 
“Sorry?” 
“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out.” 
“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling. 
“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.” 
“Okay.” 
“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our 
possessions.” 
“Right.” 
“You are not to steal food from the fridge.” 
“Okay.” 
“I am going to lock your door.” 
“You do that.” 
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of ar-
gument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind 
him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s foot-
steps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the 
slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable 
sound of the car sweeping out of the drive. 
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made 
no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could 
not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. 
The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the 
night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting 
for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned. 
The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry 
lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in 
misery. 
And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below. 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 46  
He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn’t be 
back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard their car. 
There was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices. 
Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split 
second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices 
down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly 
not troubling to do so. 
He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing 
his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he 
jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open. 
Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark 
upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. 
He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of 
his room to the head of the stairs. 
His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing 
in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing 
through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could 
see, looking up at him. 
“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a 
low, growling voice. 
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, 
but he did not lower his wand. 
“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly. 
“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’ ” growled the voice, “never 
got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you 
properly.” 
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor 
did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had re-
cently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye 
Moody’s company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an 
impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before  
 
THE  ADVANCED  GUARD 
 47  
being unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to 
do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs. 
“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.” 
Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadn’t 
heard it for more than a year. 
“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that you?” 
“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third voice, this one 
completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. “Lumos.” 
A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry 
blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, 
gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look. 
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, 
Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when 
Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched 
and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, 
who tried to smile back through his shock. 
“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the witch who 
was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had 
a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that 
was a violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!” 
“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald black wizard 
standing farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single 
gold hoop in his ear. “He looks exactly like James.” 
“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the 
back. “Lily’s eyes.” 
Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large 
chunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry 
through his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and 
beady, the other large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that 
could see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody’s own head. 
“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice  
 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 48  
lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We 
ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless 
anyone brought any Veritaserum?” 
“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said Lupin. 
“A stag,” said Harry nervously. 
“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin. 
Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring 
at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came. 
“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What if it ig-
nited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!” 
“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet-haired woman 
asked Mad-Eye interestedly. 
“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back 
pocket!” growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers 
about it anymore. . . .” He stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw 
that,” he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling. 
Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s. 
“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely. 
“F-fine . . .” 
Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, 
not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and 
suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in 
the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He 
glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly 
at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his 
hair for four days. 
“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out . . .” he mumbled. 
“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me that lured 
them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they’d 
been short-listed for the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn 
Competition. They’re heading off to the prize-giving right now. . . . 
Or they think they are.” 
THE  ADVANCED  GUARD 
 49  
Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon’s face when he realized 
there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. 
“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?” 
“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for the all-clear.” 
“Where are we going? The Burrow?” Harry asked hopefully. 
“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the 
kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curi-
ously. “Too risky. We’ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable. 
It’s taken a while. . . .” 
Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging 
from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in 
the Dursleys’ many labor-saving appliances. 
“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, pointing toward 
Moody. 
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be intro-
duced to somebody he’d thought he’d known for a year. 
“And this is Nymphadora —” 
“Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a 
shudder. “It’s Tonks.” 
“— Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname 
only,” finished Lupin. 
“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘Nympha-
dora,’” muttered Tonks. 
“And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” — he indicated the tall black 
wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Doge” — the wheezy-voiced wizard 
nodded — “Dedalus Diggle —” 
“We’ve met before,” squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his 
top hat. 
“— Emmeline Vance” — a stately looking witch in an emerald-
green shawl inclined her head — “Sturgis Podmore” — a square-jawed 
wizard with thick, straw-colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A 
pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster. 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 50  
Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were in-
troduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; it 
was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage. He also won-
dered why so many of them were there. 
“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,” 
said Lupin, as though he had read Harry’s mind; the corners of his 
mouth twitched slightly. 
“Yeah, well, the more the better,” said Moody darkly. “We’re your 
guard, Potter.” 
“We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off,” said 
Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. “We’ve got about fifteen 
minutes.” 
“Very clean, aren’t they, these Muggles?” said the witch called 
Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. “My 
dad’s Muggle-born and he’s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just 
like with wizards?” 
“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” — he turned back to Lupin — 
“what’s going on, I haven’t heard anything from anyone, what’s Vol — ?” 
Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; 
Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, “Shut up!” 
“What?” said Harry. 
“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” said Moody, 
turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing 
up at the ceiling. “Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to 
the magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum wore it —” 
And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being 
pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye. 
“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” said Tonks 
conversationally. 
“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked Moody. 
Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled it  
 
THE  ADVANCED  GUARD 
 51  
with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. 
Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him. 
“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He 
dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and 
down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. “I want 
three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.” 
“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked. 
“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way. You’re too young to Apparate, 
they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and it’s more than our life’s 
worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.” 
“Remus says you’re a good flier,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his 
deep voice. 
“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his watch. “Any-
way, you’d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go 
when the signal comes.” 
“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly. 
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking 
around with much curiosity and interest. 
“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit too clean, d’you know what I 
mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,” she added, as they entered 
Harry’s bedroom and he turned on the light. 
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. 
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not both-
ered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn 
over the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each in turn and 
thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to 
smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle 
clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the floor around it. 
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his 
trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her re-
flection in the mirror on the inside of the door. 
 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 52  
“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she said pen-
sively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. “D’you think it makes me look 
a bit peaky?” 
“Er —” said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch 
Teams of Britain and Ireland. 
“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a 
strained expression as though she were struggling to remember some-
thing. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink. 
“How did you do that?” said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her 
eyes again. 
“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at her reflection 
and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. 
“It means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting 
Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. “I was born one. 
I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training 
without any study at all, it was great.” 
“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard 
catcher was the only career he’d ever considered after Hogwarts. 
“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as well; he’s a bit 
higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed 
on Stealth and Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that 
plate when we arrived downstairs?” 
“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her, 
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing. 
Tonks chuckled. 
“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?” 
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead. 
“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not 
like people staring at his scar. 
“Well, you’ll have to learn the hard way, I’m afraid,” said Tonks. 
“Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re born, not made. Most wiz-
ards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. . . . 
THE  ADVANCED  GUARD 
 53  
But we’ve got to get going, Harry, we’re supposed to be packing,” she 
added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor. 
“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, grabbing up a few more books. 
“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack!” cried Tonks, 
waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor. 
Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew 
pell-mell into the trunk. 
“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and look-
ing down at the jumble inside. “My mum’s got this knack of getting 
stuff to fit itself in neatly — she even gets the socks to fold them-
selves — but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’s a kind of 
flick —” 
She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’s socks gave a feeble 
sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within. 
“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s all 
in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too — Scourgify —” She 
pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings van-
ished. “Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite got the hang of 
these sort of householdy spells. Right — got everything? Cauldron? 
Broom? Wow! A Firebolt?” 
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right 
hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international stan-
dard broomstick. 
“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously. “Ah 
well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go. 
Locomotor Trunk.” 
Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a 
conductor’s baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of the 
door ahead of them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her 
down the stairs carrying his broomstick. 
Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, which was 
spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 54  
Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and 
Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while 
rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the 
Dursleys. 
“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. 
“We’ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into 
the garden so we’re ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and 
uncle not to worry —” 
“They won’t,” said Harry. 
“That you’re safe —” 
“That’ll just depress them.” 
“— and you’ll see them next summer.” 
“Do I have to?” 
Lupin smiled but made no answer. 
“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward 
him with his wand. “I need to Disillusion you.” 
“You need to what?” said Harry nervously. 
“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his wand. “Lupin 
says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won’t stay on while we’re 
flying; this’ll disguise you better. Here you go —” 
He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a cu-
rious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold 
trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand 
had struck. 
“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry’s 
midriff. 
Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, 
for it didn’t look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had 
simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind 
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon. 
“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand. 
They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s beautifully kept lawn. 
THE  ADVANCED  GUARD 
 55  
“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heav-
ens. “Could’ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,” he 
barked at Harry, “we’re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks’ll 
be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be covering 
you from below. I’m going to be behind you. The rest’ll be circling us. 
We don’t break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed —” 
“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored 
him. 
“— the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break ranks. If they 
take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing 
by to take over; keep flying east and they’ll join you.” 
“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not taking this 
seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s 
cage into a harness hanging from her broom. 
“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. “Our job’s to 
deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt —” 
“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, 
calming voice. 
“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said Lupin sharply, 
pointing into the sky. 
Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among 
the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung 
his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it 
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in 
the air once more. 
“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green 
this time, exploded high above them. 
Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed 
through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, 
shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and 
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as 
though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 56  
his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, fly-
ing away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer, 
he was going home. . . . For a few glorious moments, all his problems 
seemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky. 
“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” shouted Moody 
from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching 
his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height. 
. . . Give it another quarter of a mile!” 
Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see 
nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights 
and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Ver-
non’s car. . . . The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty 
house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition 
. . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was 
drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the har-
ness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their 
ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, 
or this happy. . . . 
“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!” 
They soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glit-
tering spiderweb of lights below. 
“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low cloud ahead 
we can lose ourselves in!” called Moody. 
“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks angrily. “We’ll 
get soaked, Mad-Eye!” 
Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing 
numb on the Firebolt’s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a 
coat; he was starting to shiver. 
They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-
Eye’s instructions. Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy 
wind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember be-
ing this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch 
THE  ADVANCED  GUARD 
 57  
match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a 
storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant 
birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they 
had been flying; it felt like an hour at least. 
“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid the 
motorway!” 
Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment 
of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even 
more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfort-
able to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames. 
. . . Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring 
gleaming slightly in the moonlight. . . . Now Emmeline Vance was on 
his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then she 
too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. . . . 
“We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we’re not be-
ing followed!” Moody shouted. 
“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from the front. 
“We’re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off course we’re not 
going to get there until next week! We’re nearly there now!” 
“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. “Follow Tonks, 
Harry!” 
Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest 
collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing 
mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deep-
est black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual 
headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials. He 
wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that some-
one would have to unfreeze him from his broom. 
“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed. 
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch 
of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already 
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy 
CHAPTER  THREE 
 58  
fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them 
had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-
lamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish 
lay outside several sets of front steps. 
“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.” 
Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with 
cold. 
“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette 
lighter into the air and clicking it. 
The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the un-
lighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every 
lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square 
came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead. 
“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the 
Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the win-
dow, see? Now, come on, quick.” 
He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, 
across the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed, 
carrying Harry’s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with 
their wands out, flanking them. 
The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper win-
dow in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came 
from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate. 
“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward 
Harry’s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as 
to illuminate the writing. “Read quickly and memorize.” 
Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting 
was vaguely familiar. It said: 
The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at 
number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.

hat’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began. 
“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re inside!” 
He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand and set fire 
to it with his wand tip. As the message curled into flames and floated 
to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were 
standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw num-
ber ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen. 
“But where’s — ?” 
“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly. 
Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about num-
ber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of 
nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by 
dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had 
inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. 
The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles in-
side hadn’t even felt anything. 
“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.

CHAPTER  FOUR 
 60  
Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materi-
alized door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver door 
knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or 
letterbox. 
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard 
many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a 
chain. The door creaked open. 
“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go far inside 
and don’t touch anything.” 
Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of 
the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the 
place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoul-
der and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying 
his trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was standing on the top step and 
releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the street-
lamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed 
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and 
closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete. 
“Here —” 
He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as 
though something hot was trickling down his back this time and 
knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted. 
“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,” 
Moody whispered. 
The others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of fore-
boding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying 
person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas 
lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insub-
stantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a 
long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered over-
head and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry  
 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 61  
heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier 
and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents. 
There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley, 
emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in 
welcome as she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she 
was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen 
her. 
“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into 
a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm’s length and examining 
him critically. “You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll 
have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid. . . .” 
She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered ur-
gently, “He’s just arrived, the meeting’s started. . . .” 
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excite-
ment and began filing past Harry toward the door through which 
Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. 
Weasley held him back. 
“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and 
Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s 
over and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the 
hall,” she added in an urgent whisper. 
“Why?” 
“I don’t want to wake anything up.” 
“What d’you — ?” 
“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meet-
ing — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.” 
Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of 
long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must 
be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked 
as though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, they started up 
the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on  
 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 62  
plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads be-
longed to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose. 
Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on 
earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to 
the Darkest of wizards? 
“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?” 
“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to 
dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. “There” — they had 
reached the second landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call 
you when it’s over.” 
And she hurried off downstairs again. 
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, 
which was shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door. 
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded 
room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even 
louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quan-
tity of very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a 
hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, 
zoomed excitedly round and round their heads. 
“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear you arrive! 
Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I 
bet you have, I know our letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell 
you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, oh, we’ve got 
so much to tell you, and you’ve got to tell us — the dementors! When 
we heard — and that Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve 
looked it all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s provision 
in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of 
magic in life-threatening situations —” 
“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, closing the door 
behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during 
their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than 
ever, though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same. 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 63  
Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say 
another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white 
soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s 
shoulder. 
“Hedwig!” 
The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately 
as Harry stroked her feathers. 
“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death 
when she brought your last letters, look at this —” 
He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported 
a half-healed but clearly deep cut. 
“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, 
you know. . . .” 
“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was 
going spare, she kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were 
stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us —” 
“— swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, Hermione’s already 
said.” 
The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two 
best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his 
stomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid 
month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone. 
There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig auto-
matically, not looking at either of the others. 
“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione rather breath-
lessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.” 
“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks 
of Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry. 
“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles —” Ron 
began. 
“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either of you been 
attacked by dementors this summer?” 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 64  
“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the 
Phoenix tailing you all the time —” 
Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step 
going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed ex-
cept him. 
“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said Harry, doing his 
utmost to keep his voice even. “Had to look after myself after all, 
didn’t I?” 
“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice. 
“Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left 
before his shift had ended. He was scary.” 
“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said coldly. “If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t 
have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at 
Privet Drive all summer.” 
“Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic 
hearing?” said Hermione quietly. 
“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking 
around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this 
room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank 
stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the 
bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he 
heard someone lurking out of sight snigger. 
“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?” 
Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. “Did you — 
er — bother to ask him at all?” 
He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told 
him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing 
to improve his temper. 
“We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,” 
said Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen 
him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just  
 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 65  
made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said 
the owls might be intercepted —” 
“He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” Harry said 
shortly. “You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages 
without owls.” 
Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought that too. But 
he didn’t want you to know anything.” 
“Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted,” said Harry, watching their ex-
pressions. 
“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly disconcerted. 
“Or that I can’t take care of myself —” 
“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione anxiously. 
“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to 
join in everything that’s going on here?” said Harry, the words tum-
bling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every 
word. “How come you two are allowed to know everything that’s go-
ing on — ?” 
“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near the meet-
ings, she says we’re too young —” 
But before he knew it, Harry was shouting. 
“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! 
YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL 
BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURS-
LEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN 
YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE 
KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE? 
WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR 
SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?” 
Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past 
month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the 
hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being  
 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 66  
followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of 
finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and 
soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in 
alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads. 
“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES 
AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW 
HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!” 
Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned 
and at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge 
of tears. 
“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY 
SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN 
HAPPENING?” 
“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did —” Hermione began. 
“CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR 
YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE 
MADE YOU SWEAR —” 
“Well, he did —” 
“FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, 
NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT 
WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON —” 
“We wanted to —” 
“I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, 
HAVEN’T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER —” 
“No, honest —” 
“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now 
sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely right, Harry — I’d be furious 
if it was me!” 
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from 
them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the 
top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the 
mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry’s feet. 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 67  
“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and Hermione. 
“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron at once. 
“Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the 
Phoenix — ?” 
“It’s a secret society,” said Hermione quickly. “Dumbledore’s in 
charge, he founded it. It’s the people who fought against You-Know-
Who last time.” 
“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his 
pockets. 
“Quite a few people —” 
“— we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but we think 
there are more. . . .” 
Harry glared at them. 
“Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other. 
“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?” 
“Voldemort!” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione 
winced. “What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are 
we doing to stop him?” 
“We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings,” said 
Hermione nervously. “So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a 
general idea —” she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry’s face. 
“Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,” said Ron. 
“They’re really useful.” 
“Extendable — ?” 
“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because 
Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them 
all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of 
them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the 
Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you 
know —” 
“— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the 
Order —” said Hermione. 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 68  
“— and some of them are standing guard over something,” said 
Ron. “They’re always talking about guard duty.” 
“Couldn’t have been me, could it?” said Harry sarcastically. 
“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension. 
Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking any-
where but at Ron and Hermione. “So what have you two been doing, 
if you’re not allowed in meetings?” he demanded. “You said you’d 
been busy.” 
“We have,” said Hermione quickly. “We’ve been decontaminating 
this house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff’s been breeding in here. 
We’ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I 
think we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH!” 
With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers, 
had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidg-
eon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig 
on top of the wardrobe. 
“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as 
vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter. 
“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him. “We thought we 
heard your dulcet tones.” 
“You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all 
out,” said Fred, also beaming. “There might be a couple of people fifty 
miles away who didn’t hear you.” 
“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked Harry 
grumpily. 
“With distinction,” said Fred, who was holding what looked like a 
piece of very long, flesh-colored string. 
“It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down 
the stairs,” said Ron. 
“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, Harry, you’re 
interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,” he added in response to  
 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 69  
Harry’s raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw 
was trailing out onto the landing. “We’re trying to hear what’s going 
on downstairs.” 
“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. “If Mum sees 
one of them again . . .” 
“It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re having,” said 
Fred. 
The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared. 
“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. “I 
thought I heard your voice.” 
Turning to Fred and George she said, “It’s no go with the Extend-
able Ears, she’s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen 
door.” 
“How d’you know?” said George, looking crestfallen. 
“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny. “You just chuck stuff 
at the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed. 
I’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they 
just soar away from it, so there’s no way the Extendable Ears will be 
able to get under the gap.” 
Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. I really fancied finding out what 
old Snape’s been up to.” 
“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?” 
“Yeah,” said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on 
one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. “Giving a report. Top 
secret.” 
“Git,” said Fred idly. 
“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly. 
Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us 
when he sees us. . . .” 
“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though that settled the 
matter. 
 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 70  
Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for 
information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank 
onto the bed opposite the others. 
“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in Egypt.” 
“He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the 
Order,” said Fred. “He says he misses the tombs, but,” he smirked, 
“there are compensations. . . .” 
“What d’you mean?” 
“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s got a job at 
Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish —” 
“— and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” sniggered 
Fred. 
“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in Romania, 
Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so 
Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.” 
“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he had heard, the 
third Weasley brother was working in the Department of Interna-
tional Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic. 
At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly 
significant looks. 
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and 
Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice. 
“Why not?” 
“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks what-
ever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said. 
“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly. 
“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacter-
istically ugly look on his face. 
“What’s happened?” Harry said. 
“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row 
with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts. . . .” 
“It was the first week back after term ended,” said Ron. “We were 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 71  
about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d 
been promoted.” 
“You’re kidding?” said Harry. 
Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, 
Harry’s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his 
first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large 
oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by 
Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that — they all 
thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad). 
“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into 
a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. 
They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and 
informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, 
he wasn’t going to complain. . . .” 
“So how come they promoted him?” 
“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very 
keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped 
yelling. “He came home really pleased with himself — even more 
pleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been 
offered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really good one for some-
one only a year out of Hogwarts — Junior Assistant to the Minister. 
He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.” 
“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly. 
“Why not?” said Harry. 
“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry 
checking that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore,” said 
George. 
“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these days, see,” said 
Fred. “They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-Know-
Who’s back.” 
“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s in league with 
Dumbledore can clear out their desks,” said George. 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 72  
“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with Dum-
bledore, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his 
Muggle obsession —” 
“But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked Harry, confused. 
“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his 
office because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and 
Dumbledore.” 
Harry let out a low whistle. 
“Bet Percy loved that.” 
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way. 
“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of ter-
rible stuff. He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy 
reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no 
ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a 
lot of money, I mean —” 
“What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an an-
gry cat. 
“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. He said Dad 
was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was 
heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and 
that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the 
Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the 
Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong 
to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and 
left. He’s living here in London now.” 
Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of 
Ron’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things 
to Mr. Weasley. 
“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — crying and 
stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed 
the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work — 
ignores him, I s’pose.” 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 73  
“But Percy must know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry slowly. “He’s 
not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk every-
thing without proof —” 
“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said Ron, shoot-
ing Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the only evidence was your word 
and . . . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough.” 
“Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,” said Hermione tartly, and 
the others all nodded. 
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, looking around at 
them all. They were all regarding him warily. 
“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily Prophet?” Hermi-
one asked nervously. 
“Yeah, I have!” said Harry. 
“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” Hermione asked 
still more anxiously. 
“Not cover to cover,” said Harry defensively. “If they were going 
to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, 
wouldn’t it!” 
The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried 
on, “Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but 
they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week.” 
“But I’d have seen —” 
“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said 
Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m not talking about big articles. They 
just slip you in, like you’re a standing joke.” 
“What d’you — ?” 
“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. 
“They’re just building on Rita’s stuff.” 
“But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she?” 
“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got any choice,” 
Hermione added with satisfaction. “But she laid the foundation for 
what they’re trying to do now.” 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 74  
“Which is what?” said Harry impatiently. 
“Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the 
place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter’s sto-
ries about him in a hurry. 
“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded, 
attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or some-
thing,” said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant 
for Harry to hear these facts quickly. “They keep slipping in snide 
comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say some-
thing like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny 
accident or anything it’s ‘let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his forehead 
or we’ll be asked to worship him next —’ ” 
“I don’t want anyone to worship —” Harry began hotly. 
“I know you don’t,” said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. 
“I know, Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn 
you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet 
anything. They want wizards on the street to think you’re just some 
stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because 
he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.” 
“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my parents!” 
Harry spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but 
couldn’t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they think 
I’d rather it’d never —” 
“We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly. 
“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors at-
tacking you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s told them to keep that 
quiet. That should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control demen-
tors. They haven’t even reported that you broke the International 
Statute of Secrecy — we thought they would, it would tie in so well 
with this image of you as some stupid show-off — we think they’re

biding their time until you’re expelled, then they’re really going to go 
to town — I mean, if  you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on hastily, 
“you really shouldn’t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there’s no 
case against you.” 
They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think 
about it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved 
the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the 
stairs. 
“Uh-oh.” 
Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud 
crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley ap-
peared in the bedroom doorway. 
“The meeting’s over, you can come down and have dinner now, 
everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And who’s left all those Dung-
bombs outside the kitchen door?” 
“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblushingly. “He loves playing with 
them.” 
“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have been Kreacher, 
he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don’t forget to keep your 
voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you 
been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please. . . .” 
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the 
room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again. Both of 
them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared that he 
would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight 
of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed. 
“Look . . .” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione 
said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, Harry, we really don’t blame 
you, but you’ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumble-
dore —” 
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly. 
 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 76  
He cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dumble-
dore — the very thought of him made Harry’s insides burn with 
anger again. 
“Who’s Kreacher?” he asked. 
“The house-elf who lives here,” said Ron. “Nutter. Never met one 
like him.” 
Hermione frowned at Ron. 
“He’s not a nutter, Ron —” 
“His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a 
plaque just like his mother,” said Ron irritably. “Is that normal, 
Hermione?” 
“Well — well, if he is a bit strange, it’s not his fault —” 
Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. 
“Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew —” 
“It’s not ‘spew’!” said Hermione heatedly. “It’s the Society for the 
Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, Dumbledore says we 
should be kind to Kreacher too —” 
“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron. “C’mon, I’m starving.” 
He led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before 
they could descend the stairs — “Hold it!” Ron breathed, flinging out 
an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any farther. “They’re 
still in the hall, we might be able to hear something —” 
The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy 
hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of 
Harry’s guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very 
center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and promi-
nent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. 
Harry leaned farther over the banisters. He was very interested in what 
Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . . 
A thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of Harry’s 
eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cau-
tiously lowering the Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people 
NUMBER  TWELVE, 
GRIMMAULD  PLACE 
 77  
below. A moment later, however, they began to move toward the front 
door and out of sight. 
“Dammit,” Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable 
Ear back up again. 
They heard the front door open and then close. 
“Snape never eats here,” Ron told Harry quietly. “Thank God. 
C’mon.” 
“And don’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,” 
Hermione whispered. 
As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall they saw 
Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its 
many locks and bolts behind those who had just left. 
“We’re eating down in the kitchen,” Mrs. Weasley whispered, 
meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. “Harry, dear, if you’ll just 
tiptoe across the hall, it’s through this door here —” 
CRASH. 
“Tonks!” cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind 
her. 
“I’m sorry!” wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. “It’s that 
stupid umbrella stand, that’s the second time I’ve tripped over —” 
But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, earsplitting, 
bloodcurdling screech. 
The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown 
apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry 
thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which 
an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though 
she was being tortured — then he realized it was simply a life-size por-
trait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen 
in his life. 
The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing 
skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall 
behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that 
CHAPTER  FOUR 
 78  
Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands 
over his ears. 
Lupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the cur-
tains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she 
screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though try-
ing to tear at their faces. 
“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, 
freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my 
fathers —” 
Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging 
the huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned 
the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, 
Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then a man with long 
black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry. 
“Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, seizing the 
curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned. 
The old woman’s face blanched. 
“Yoooou!” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. 
“Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!” 
“I said — shut — UP!” roared the man, and with a stupendous ef-
fort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again. 
The old woman’s screeches died and an echoing silence fell. 
Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, 
Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face him. 
“Hello, Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my mother.”

our — ?” 
“My dear old mum, yeah,” said Sirius. “We’ve been trying 
to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Stick-
ing Charm on the back of the canvas. Let’s get downstairs, quick, 
before they all wake up again.” 
“But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” Harry asked, 
bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the 
way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them. 
“Hasn’t anyone told you? This was my parents’ house,” said Sirius. 
“But I’m the last Black left, so it’s mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore 
for headquarters — about the only useful thing I’ve been able to do.” 
Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and 
bitter Sirius’s voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom 
of the stairs and through a door leading into the basement kitchen. 
It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room 
with rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire 
at the far end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like 
battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy 
Y 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 80  
iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had 
been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table 
stood in the middle of the room, littered with rolls of parchment, gob-
lets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. 
Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were talking quietly with their heads 
together at the end of the table. 
Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-
haired man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and 
jumped to his feet. 
“Harry!” Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him and 
shaking his hand vigorously. “Good to see you!” 
Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a 
ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table. 
“Journey all right, Harry?” Bill called, trying to gather up twelve 
scrolls at once. “Mad-Eye didn’t make you come via Greenland, 
then?” 
“He tried,” said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately 
sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. “Oh 
no — sorry —” 
“Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she re-
paired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light 
caused by Mrs. Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what 
looked like the plan of a building. 
Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the 
table and stuffed it into Bill’s heavily laden arms. 
“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of 
meetings,” she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser 
from which she started unloading dinner plates. 
Bill took out his wand, muttered “Evanesco!” and the scrolls 
vanished. 
“Sit down, Harry,” said Sirius. “You’ve met Mundungus, haven’t 
you?” 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 81  
The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, 
grunting snore and then jerked awake. 
“Some’n say m’ name?” Mundungus mumbled sleepily. “I ’gree 
with Sirius. . . .” 
He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his 
droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled. 
“The meeting’s over, Dung,” said Sirius, as they all sat down 
around him at the table. “Harry’s arrived.” 
“Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his 
matted ginger hair. “Blimey, so ’e ’as. Yeah . . . you all right, ’arry?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry. 
Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at 
Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. He stuck it in his mouth, 
ignited the end of it with his wand, and took a deep pull on it. Great 
billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds. 
“Owe you a ’pology,” grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly 
cloud. 
“For the last time, Mundungus,” called Mrs. Weasley, “will you 
please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we’re 
about to eat!” 
“Ah,” said Mundungus. “Right. Sorry, Molly.” 
The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back 
in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered. 
“And if you want dinner before midnight I’ll need a hand,” Mrs. 
Weasley said to the room at large. “No, you can stay where you are, 
Harry dear, you’ve had a long journey —” 
“What can I do, Molly?” said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding for-
ward. 
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive. 
“Er — no, it’s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you’ve done 
enough today —” 
“No, no, I want to help!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 82  
as she hurried toward the dresser from which Ginny was collecting 
cutlery. 
Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of 
their own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley 
stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, 
more goblets, and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table 
with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at 
him. 
“Seen old Figgy since?” he asked. 
“No,” said Harry, “I haven’t seen anyone.” 
“See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning forward, a 
pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a business opportunity —” 
Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was 
only Crookshanks, Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound 
himself once around Harry’s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius’s 
lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the 
ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry. 
“Had a good summer so far?” 
“No, it’s been lousy,” said Harry. 
For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius’s face. 
“Don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself.” 
“What?” said Harry incredulously. 
“Personally, I’d have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly strug-
gle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think 
you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about, 
stretch your legs, get into a few fights. . . . I’ve been stuck inside for a 
month.” 
“How come?” asked Harry, frowning. 
“Because the Ministry of Magic’s still after me, and Voldemort will 
know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have 
told him, so my big disguise is useless. There’s not much I can do for 
the Order of the Phoenix . . . or so Dumbledore feels.” 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 83  
There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in 
which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name that told Harry that Sirius 
was not very happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden 
upsurge of affection for his godfather. 
“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said bracingly. 
“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to Snape’s reports, 
having to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life 
while I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . 
asking me how the cleaning’s going —” 
“What cleaning?” asked Harry. 
“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” said Sirius, 
waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. “No one’s lived here for 
ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old 
house-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in 
ages —” 
“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any 
attention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an 
empty goblet. “This solid silver, mate?” 
“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. “Finest fifteenth-
century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.” 
“That’d come off, though,” muttered Mundungus, polishing it 
with his cuff. 
“Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley 
shrieked. 
Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second 
later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a 
large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy 
wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air 
toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a 
halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden sur-
face, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents 
everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 84  
point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius’s right 
hand had been seconds before. 
“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE 
WAS NO NEED — I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BE-
CAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU 
DON’T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY 
TINY LITTLE THING!” 
“We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying for-
ward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. “Sorry Sirius, 
mate — didn’t mean to —” 
Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had top-
pled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crook-
shanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from 
whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness. 
“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of 
the table, “your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of re-
sponsibility now you’ve come of age —” 
“— none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” Mrs. 
Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto 
the table and spilling almost as much again. “Bill didn’t feel the need 
to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met! 
Percy —” 
She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her 
husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden. 
“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly. 
“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate 
for her and handing it across the table. 
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and 
cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their 
food. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, “I’ve been mean-
ing to tell you, there’s something trapped in that writing desk in the 
drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 85  
be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at 
it before we let it out.” 
“Whatever you like,” said Sirius indifferently. 
“The curtains in there are full of doxies too,” Mrs. Weasley went 
on. “I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.” 
“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his 
voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did. 
Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by 
transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each 
time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry’s 
bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape’s, 
shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then 
sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a 
regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and 
Ginny started requesting their favorite noses. 
“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . .” 
Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression 
that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table. 
Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion 
about goblins. 
“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill. “I still can’t work 
out whether they believe he’s back or not. ’Course, they might prefer 
not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.” 
“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr. 
Weasley, shaking his head. “They’ve suffered losses too. Remember 
that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near 
Nottingham?” 
“I think it depends what they’re offered,” said Lupin. “And I’m not 
talking about gold; if they’re offered freedoms we’ve been denying 
them for centuries they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had 
any luck with Ragnok, Bill?” 
“He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,” said Bill. “He 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 86  
hasn’t stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the 
Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, 
you know —” 
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of 
Bill’s words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around 
in their seats. 
“. . . and then,” choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, 
“and then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says to me, ’e says, ‘ ’ere, Dung, where 
didja get all them toads from? ’Cos some son of a Bludger’s gone and 
nicked all mine!’ And I says, ‘Nicked all your toads, Will, what next? 
So you’ll be wanting some more, then?’ And if you’ll believe me, lads, 
the gormless gargoyle buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what 
’e paid in the first place —” 
“I don’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, 
thank you very much, Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as 
Ron slumped forward onto the table, howling with laughter. 
“Beg pardon, Molly,” said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and 
winking at Harry. “But, you know, Will nicked ’em orf Warty Harris 
in the first place so I wasn’t really doing nothing wrong —” 
“I don’t know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundun-
gus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,” said Mrs. 
Weasley coldly. 
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer; 
George was hiccuping. For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very 
nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large 
rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather. 
“Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus,” said Sirius in an 
undertone. 
“How come he’s in the Order?” Harry said very quietly. 
“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks — well, he 
would, seeing as he’s one himself. But he’s also very loyal to Dumble- 
 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 87  
dore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have some-
one like Dung around, he hears things we don’t. But Molly thinks 
inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn’t forgiven him 
for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.” 
Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waist-
band on Harry’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was 
saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley’s). He lay down 
his spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was lean-
ing back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning 
widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured 
Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on 
the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase. 
“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn. 
“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and 
turning to look at Harry. “You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought 
the first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking 
questions about Voldemort.” 
The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry as-
sociated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had 
been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone 
around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name. Lupin, who 
had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, look-
ing wary. 
“I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and Hermione but 
they said we’re not allowed in the Order, so —” 
“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re too young.” 
She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its 
arms, every trace of drowsiness gone. 
“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to 
ask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle 
house for a month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —” 
 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 88  
“Hang on!” interrupted George loudly. 
“How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said Fred angrily. 
“We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you 
haven’t told us a single stinking thing!” said George. 
“ ‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’ ” said Fred, in a high-
pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s. “Harry’s not 
even of age!” 
“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the Order’s doing,” 
said Sirius calmly. “That’s your parents’ decision. Harry, on the other 
hand —” 
“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” said Mrs. 
Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. “You 
haven’t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?” 
“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though ready-
ing himself for a fight. 
“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,” said 
Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words. 
Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to 
Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling 
amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation 
with her mouth slightly open. Lupin’s eyes were fixed on Sirius. 
“I don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,” said 
Sirius. “But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again, 
there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has 
more right than most to —” 
“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. 
Weasley. “He’s only fifteen and —” 
“— and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius, 
“and more than some —” 
“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice ris-
ing, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he’s still —” 
“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently. 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 89  
“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her 
cheeks. “He’s not James, Sirius!” 
“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly. 
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you 
talk about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend 
back!” 
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry. 
“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however 
much you might look like him!” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still bor-
ing into Sirius. “You are still at school and adults responsible for you 
should not forget it!” 
“Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded Sirius, his 
voice rising. 
“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why 
Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and —” 
“We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you 
please!” said Sirius loudly. 
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. “Arthur, 
back me up!” 
Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and 
cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when 
he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore 
knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will 
have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at head-
quarters —” 
“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask 
whatever he likes!” 
“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as 
Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about 
to get an ally, “I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the 
facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled 
version from . . . others.” 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 90  
His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least, 
knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge. 
“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around 
the table for support that did not come, “well . . . I can see I’m going 
to be overruled. I’ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his rea-
sons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as some-
one who has got Harry’s best interests at heart —” 
“He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly. 
“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?” 
“He’s got me!” 
“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing is, it’s been 
rather difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up 
in Azkaban, hasn’t it?” 
Sirius started to rise from his chair. 
“Molly, you’re not the only person at this table who cares about 
Harry,” said Lupin sharply. “Sirius, sit down.” 
Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into 
his chair, his face white. 
“I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,” Lupin continued. 
“He’s old enough to decide for himself.” 
“I want to know what’s been going on,” Harry said at once. 
He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched by what she 
had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at 
her mollycoddling. . . . Sirius was right, he was not a child. 
“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. “Ginny — 
Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this 
kitchen, now.” 
There was instant uproar. 
“We’re of age!” Fred and George bellowed together. 
“If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted Ron. 
“Mum, I want to!” wailed Ginny. 
 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 91  
“NO!” shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. “I 
absolutely forbid —” 
“Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. Weasley wearily. 
“They are of age —” 
“They’re still at school —” 
“But they’re legally adults now,” said Mr. Weasley in the same tired 
voice. 
Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face. 
“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron —” 
“Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!” said 
Ron hotly. “Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting 
Harry’s eyes. 
For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn’t 
tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the 
dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they 
looked at each other. 
“ ’Course I will,” Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed. 
“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Fine! Ginny — BED!” 
Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming 
at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall 
Mrs. Black’s earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried 
off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he had returned, 
closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table 
again, that Sirius spoke. 
“Okay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?” 
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been ob-
sessing him for a month. 
“Where’s Voldemort? What’s he doing? I’ve been trying to watch 
the Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces 
at the name, “and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet, 
no funny deaths or anything —” 
 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 92  
“That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet,” said 
Sirius, “not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.” 
“More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin. 
“How come he’s stopped killing people?” Harry asked. He knew 
that Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone. 
“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself at the mo-
ment,” said Sirius. “It would be dangerous for him. His comeback 
didn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it 
up.” 
“Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with a satisfied 
smile. 
“How?” Harry asked perplexedly. 
“You weren’t supposed to survive!” said Sirius. “Nobody apart from 
his Death Eaters was supposed to know he’d come back. But you sur-
vived to bear witness.” 
“And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the mo-
ment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure 
Dumbledore knew at once.” 
“How has that helped?” Harry asked. 
“Are you kidding?” said Bill incredulously. “Dumbledore was the 
only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!” 
“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the 
Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,” said Sirius. 
“So what’s the Order been doing?” said Harry, looking around at 
them all. 
“Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can’t carry out 
his plans,” said Sirius. 
“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked quickly. 
“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s 
shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.” 
“So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?” 
“Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” said Sirius. “In 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 93  
the old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wiz-
ards he’d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death 
Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard him planning to 
recruit the giants; well, they’ll be just one group he’s after. He’s cer-
tainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a 
dozen Death Eaters.” 
“So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?” 
“We’re doing our best,” said Lupin. 
“How?” 
“Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as pos-
sible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their 
guard,” said Bill. “It’s proving tricky, though.” 
“Why?” 
“Because of the Ministry’s attitude,” said Tonks. “You saw Cor-
nelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry. Well, he hasn’t 
shifted his position at all. He’s absolutely refusing to believe it’s 
happened.” 
“But why?” said Harry desperately. “Why’s he being so stupid? If 
Dumbledore —” 
“Ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem,” said Mr. Weasley 
with a wry smile. “Dumbledore.” 
“Fudge is frightened of him, you see,” said Tonks sadly. 
“Frightened of Dumbledore?” said Harry incredulously. 
“Frightened of what he’s up to,” said Mr. Weasley. “You see, Fudge 
thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumble-
dore wants to be Minister of Magic.” 
“But Dumbledore doesn’t want —” 
“Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s never wanted the 
Minister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when 
Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he’s 
never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, 
even though Dumbledore never applied for the job.” 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 94  
“Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much cleverer than he is, 
a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he 
was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,” said Lupin. “But 
it seems that he’s become fond of power now, and much more confi-
dent. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince 
himself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up 
trouble for the sake of it.” 
“How can he think that?” said Harry angrily. “How can he think 
Dumbledore would just make it all up — that I’d make it all up?” 
“Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would mean trouble like 
the Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,” said 
Sirius bitterly. “Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much 
more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s lying to destabi-
lize him.” 
“You see the problem,” said Lupin. “While the Ministry insists 
there is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people 
he’s back, especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the first 
place. What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily on the Daily 
Prophet not to report any of what they’re calling Dumbledore’s rumor-
mongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely un-
aware anything’s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the 
Death Eaters if they’re using the Imperius Curse.” 
“But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said Harry, looking around 
at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. “You’re 
letting people know he’s back?” 
They all smiled humorlessly. 
“Well, as everyone thinks I’m a mad mass murderer and the Min-
istry’s put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll 
up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?” said Sirius restlessly. 
“And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the commu-
nity,” said Lupin. “It’s an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.” 
 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 95  
“Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they 
started shooting their mouths off,” said Sirius, “and it’s very important 
for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Volde-
mort will have them.” 
“We’ve managed to convince a couple of people, though,” said Mr. 
Weasley. “Tonks here, for one — she’s too young to have been in the 
Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a 
huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real asset too. He’s in 
charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s been feeding the Ministry infor-
mation that Sirius is in Tibet.” 
“But if none of you’s putting the news out that Voldemort’s 
back —” Harry began. 
“Who said none of us was putting the news out?” said Sirius. “Why 
d’you think Dumbledore’s in such trouble?” 
“What d’you mean?” Harry asked. 
“They’re trying to discredit him,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you see the 
Daily Prophet last week? They reported that he’d been voted out of the 
Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because 
he’s getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true, he was voted out 
by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort’s 
return. They’ve demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizen-
gamot — that’s the Wizard High Court — and they’re talking about 
taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.” 
“But Dumbledore says he doesn’t care what they do as long as they 
don’t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,” said Bill, grinning. 
“It’s no laughing matter,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. “If he carries on 
defying the Ministry like this, he could end up in Azkaban and the 
last thing we want is Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who 
knows Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, he’s going 
to go cautiously for a while. If Dumbledore’s out of the way — well, 
You-Know-Who will have a clear field.” 
 
CHAPTER  FIVE 
 96  
“But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it’s bound 
to get out that he’s come back, isn’t it?” asked Harry desperately. 
“Voldemort doesn’t march up to people’s houses and bang on their 
front doors, Harry,” said Sirius. “He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails 
them. He’s well-practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, gather-
ing followers is only one thing he’s interested in, he’s got other plans 
too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he’s con-
centrating on them at the moment.” 
“What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked swiftly. 
He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of 
looks before Sirius said, “Stuff he can only get by stealth.” 
When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, “Like a 
weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.” 
“When he was powerful before?” 
“Yes.” 
“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something worse than 
the Avada Kedavra — ?” 
“That’s enough.” 
Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry had 
not noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were 
crossed and she looked furious. 
“I want you in bed, now. All of you,” she added, looking around at 
Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione. 
“You can’t boss us —” Fred began. 
“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling slightly as 
she looked at Sirius. “You’ve given Harry plenty of information. Any 
more and you might just as well induct him into the Order 
straightaway.” 
“Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I’ll join, I want to join, I want to 
fight —” 
“No.” 
It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin. 
THE  ORDER  OF 
THE  PHOENIX 
 97  
“The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,” he said. “Wiz-
ards who have left school,” he added, as Fred and George opened their 
mouths. “There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, 
any of you . . . I think Molly’s right, Sirius. We’ve said enough.” 
Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned im-
periously to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and 
Harry, recognizing defeat, followed suit.

rs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim. 
“I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,” she 
said as they reached the first landing. “We’ve got a busy day tomorrow. 
I expect Ginny’s asleep,” she added to Hermione, “so try not to wake 
her up.” 
“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione 
bade them good night and they were climbing to the next floor. “If 
Ginny’s not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything 
they said downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm. . . .” 
“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing, 
pointing them into their bedroom. “Off to bed with you.” 
“ ’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins. 
“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking. 
Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The 
bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had 
on first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very 
slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry 
put on his pajamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly 
M

bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling 
their wings restlessly. 
“We can’t let them out to hunt every night,” Ron explained as he 
pulled on his maroon pajamas. “Dumbledore doesn’t want too many 
owls swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh 
yeah . . . I forgot. . . .” 
He crossed to the door and bolted it. 
“What’re you doing that for?” 
“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First night I was 
here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you 
don’t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. 
Anyway . . .” He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then 
turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline 
by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window. “What d’you 
reckon?” 
Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant. 
“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they?” 
he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. “I mean, all 
they’ve really said is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining 
Vol —” 
There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron. 
“— demort,” said Harry firmly. “When are you going to start using 
his name? Sirius and Lupin do.” 
Ron ignored this last comment. “Yeah, you’re right,” he said. “We 
already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extend-
able Ears. The only new bit was —” 
Crack. 
“OUCH!” 
“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up here.” 
“You two just Apparated on my knees!” 
“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark —” 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 100  
Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down 
from Ron’s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry’s mattress 
descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet. 
“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly. 
“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry. 
“Let slip, more like,” said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. 
“We didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?” 
“What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry. 
“Could be anything,” said Fred. 
“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, 
can there?” said Ron. “What’s worse than death?” 
“Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at once,” sug-
gested George. 
“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people,” said 
Ron fearfully. 
“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,” said Harry. “He 
doesn’t need anything more efficient than that.” 
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were 
wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate. 
“So who d’you thinks got it now?” asked George. 
“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly nervous. 
“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred. 
“Where?” said Ron quickly. “Hogwarts?” 
“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s where he hid the Sorcerer’s Stone!” 
“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!” said 
Ron. 
“Not necessarily,” said Fred. 
“Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,” said George. “Look at 
Ginny.” 
“What d’you mean?” said Harry. 
“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey 
Hexes, have you?” 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 101  
“Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed. “Listen!” 
They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs again. 
“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud 
crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few 
seconds later and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; 
Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they were talking or 
not. 
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked 
again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and 
George. 
“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron regretfully. 
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had 
been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie 
awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to 
Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and 
once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way up-
stairs. . . . In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and 
down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical 
Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be 
studyin’ weapons this term. . . .” And Harry saw that the creatures had 
cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him. . . . He ducked. . . . 
The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his 
bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was filling the room. 
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs 
you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than she thought 
and she’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.” 
Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and break-
fasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room 
on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The 
carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot 
on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though 
swarming with invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 102  
Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather 
peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths. Each of 
them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at 
the end. 
“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley said to Harry 
and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of 
black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve 
never seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s been doing 
for the last ten years —” 
Hermione’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry dis-
tinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these 
words. 
“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage —” 
“You’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to, 
Hermione,” said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a 
bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feed-
ing Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring look. “I keep him 
upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . .” 
He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to ex-
amine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, 
was shaking slightly. 
“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart,” said Sirius, peering 
through the keyhole, “but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a 
shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be 
something much worse.” 
“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley. 
They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told 
Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of 
the night before. 
A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by 
the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previ-
ous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand. 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 103  
“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said Sirius exasperat-
edly, hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering 
down the stairs as Mrs. Black’s screeches echoed up through the house 
once more: “Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children 
of filth . . .” 
“Close the door, please, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. 
Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing room 
door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had 
obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait be-
cause she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the 
hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a 
deep voice he recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s 
just relieved me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a re-
port for Dumbledore. . . .” 
Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regret-
fully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party. 
Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in 
Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on 
the sofa. 
“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and 
their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d 
rather nobody needed it.” 
She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the cur-
tains, and beckoned them all forward. 
“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” she said. 
“They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one 
good squirt will paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw 
them in this bucket.” 
She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own 
spray. “All right — squirt!” 
Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown 
doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 104  
whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered 
with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry 
caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair 
and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below. 
Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket. 
“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply. “Spray that 
at once and throw it away!” 
Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between 
his forefinger and thumb. 
“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face 
so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he 
pocketed it with a wink. 
“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snack-
boxes,” George told Harry under his breath. 
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his 
nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner 
of his mouth, “What are Skiving Snackboxes?” 
“Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a 
wary eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill 
enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have 
been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-
coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you 
throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hos-
pital wing, you swallow the purple half —” 
“ ‘— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the 
leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would other-
wise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re 
putting in the adverts, anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged over 
out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray 
doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket. “But they still 
need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trou-
ble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.”

“Testers?” 
“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fan-
cies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —” 
“Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George. 
“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, pretending to be ad-
justing the nozzle on his spray. 
“Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” said Fred, 
dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with 
her scarf before returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mail-
order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily 
Prophet last week.” 
“All thanks to you, mate,” said George. “But don’t worry . . . Mum 
hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of 
it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.” 
Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thou-
sand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament 
to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was 
still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown 
to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a 
suitable career for two of her sons. 
The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was 
past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, 
sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of dis-
gust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer 
buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; un-
conscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside 
a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing 
and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks. 
“I think we’ll tackle those after lunch.” 
Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing 
on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd 
assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled 
CHAPTER  SIX

snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages 
Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crys-
tal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was 
quite sure was blood. 
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley. 
“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs. 
Blacks screeches started up again from down below. “I’ll bring up 
some sandwiches.” 
She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once, 
everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep. 
They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of pre-
cariously balanced cauldrons. 
“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “What’s he brought all those caul-
drons for?” 
“Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said Harry. “Isn’t 
that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? 
Picking up dodgy cauldrons?” 
“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundun-
gus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. 
“Blimey, Mum won’t like that. . . .” 
He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening 
intently. Mrs. Black’s screaming had stopped again. 
“Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,” Fred muttered, 
frowning with concentration. “Can’t hear properly . . . d’you reckon 
we can risk the Extendable Ears?” 
“Might be worth it,” said George. “I could sneak upstairs and get a 
pair —” 
But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from 
downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of 
them could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of 
her voice. 
 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 107  
“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN 
GOODS!” 
“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said Fred, with a 
satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow 
Mrs. Weasley’s voice to permeate the room better. “It makes such a 
nice change.” 
“— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T 
GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAG-
GING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE —” 
“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said George, shaking 
his head. “You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a 
head of steam and goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a 
go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to 
be following you, Harry — and there goes Sirius’s mum again —” 
Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from 
the portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the 
noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room. 
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it 
was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several 
times too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there 
was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its 
eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large 
and rather snoutlike. 
The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as 
though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and 
doggedly, toward the far end of the room, muttering under its breath 
all the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog’s, “. . . Smells like 
a drain and a criminal to boot, but she’s no better, nasty old blood 
traitor with her brats messing up my Mistress’s house, oh my poor 
Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they’ve let in her house, 
what would she say to old Kreacher, oh the shame of it, Mudbloods  
 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 108  
and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can 
he do. . . .” 
“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a 
snap. 
The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and then gave 
a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise. 
“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning around and 
bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, 
“Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.” 
“Sorry?” said George. “Didn’t catch that last bit.” 
“Kreacher said nothing,” said the elf, with a second bow to George, 
adding in a clear undertone, “and there’s its twin, unnatural little 
beasts they are.” 
Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened 
up, eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that 
they could not hear him as he continued to mutter. 
“. . . and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if 
my Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher 
doesn’t know his name, what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t 
know . . .” 
“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said Hermione tentatively. “Harry 
Potter.” 
Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furi-
ously than ever. 
“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, 
if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she 
say —” 
“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny together, very 
angrily. 
“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione whispered, “he’s not in his right 
mind, he doesn’t know what he’s —” 
 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 109  
“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he’s saying,” 
said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike. 
Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry. 
“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be 
true, that’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders 
how he did it —” 
“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred. 
“What do you want anyway?” George asked. 
Kreacher’s huge eyes darted onto George. 
“Kreacher is cleaning,” he said evasively. 
“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry. 
Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the door-
way. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and 
Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the 
sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that 
flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor. 
“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently. “Now, what are you up 
to?” 
“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher lives to serve the 
noble house of Black —” 
“— and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said Sirius. 
“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, bowing again, 
and continuing in an undertone, “Master was a nasty ungrateful swine 
who broke his mother’s heart —” 
“My mother didn’t have a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius snapped. “She 
kept herself alive out of pure spite.” 
Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master says,” then 
muttered furiously, “Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother’s 
boots, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher 
serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was —” 
“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. “Every time  
 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 110  
you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to 
your room so we can’t throw it out.” 
“Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in 
Master’s house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would 
never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries 
it’s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let 
Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it —” 
“I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at 
the opposite wall. “She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm 
on the back of it, I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. 
Now go away, Kreacher.” 
It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; never-
theless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent 
of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room. 
“— comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh my 
poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum liv-
ing in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers 
and he’s back, they say he’s a murderer too —” 
“Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!” said Sirius irritably, and 
he slammed the door shut on the elf. 
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said Hermione pleadingly, “I 
don’t think he realizes we can hear him.” 
“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from 
my mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul 
little —” 
“If you just set him free,” said Hermione hopefully, “maybe —” 
“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,” said 
Sirius curtly. “And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to 
him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.” 
Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had 
been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the oth-
ers followed. 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 111  
The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as 
though doxies had gnawed it in places; nevertheless, the golden thread 
with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show 
them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to 
the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read: 
 
The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black 
“Toujours Pur” 
 
“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the 
tree. 
“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred 
hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother 
blasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of 
muttering the story under his breath.” 
“You ran away from home?” 
“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had enough.” 
“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him. 
“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good 
about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out 
at your dad’s during the school holidays, and then when I was seven-
teen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent 
bit of gold — he’s been wiped off here too, that’s probably why — 
anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. 
and Mrs. Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.” 
“But . . . why did you . . . ?” 
“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long, un-
kempt hair. “Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with 
their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you prac-
tically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . 
that’s him.” 
Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 112  
regulus black. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) fol-
lowed the date of birth. 
“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much better son, as 
I was constantly reminded.” 
“But he died,” said Harry. 
“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.” 
“You’re kidding!” 
“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell 
what kind of wizards my family were?” said Sirius testily. 
“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?” 
“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right 
idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting 
rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t 
alone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed 
his true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . . 
They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get 
power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right lit-
tle hero for joining up at first.” 
“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively. 
“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on 
Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important 
enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out 
after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being 
asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your 
resignation to Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.” 
“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice. 
She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge 
tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in 
the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for 
some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to 
the tapestry. 
 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 113  
“I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas Nigellus . . . my 
great-great-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever 
had . . . and Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother’s . . . tried to 
force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal . . . and 
dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading 
house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays . . . of course, 
anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were dis-
owned. I see Tonks isn’t on here. Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t 
take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever anyone in the 
family asks him. . . .” 
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised. 
“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said 
Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here 
either, look —” 
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, 
Bellatrix and Narcissa. 
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, re-
spectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-
born, Ted Tonks, so —” 
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. 
Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names 
to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold 
embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single 
vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco. 
“You’re related to the Malfoys!” 
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re 
only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your 
choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are 
cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my second cousin 
once removed. But there’s no point looking for them on here — if 
ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it’s the Weasleys.” 
 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 114  
But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda’s 
burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodol-
phus Lestrange. 
“Lestrange . . .” Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something 
in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he 
couldn’t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation 
in the pit of his stomach. 
“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly. 
Harry looked at him curiously. 
“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch, 
Junior,” said Sirius in the same brusque voice. “Rodolphus’s brother, 
Rabastan, was with them too.” 
And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside 
Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and 
memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, 
who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to 
Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his 
downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for 
her loyalty. 
“You never said she was your —” 
“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I’m 
concerned, they’re not my family. She’s certainly not my family. I 
haven’t seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her 
coming in to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives like 
her?” 
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn’t mean — I was just surprised, 
that’s all —” 
“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize,” Sirius mumbled at once. He 
turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. “I don’t 
like being back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room. “I 
never thought I’d be stuck in this house again.” 
Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 115  
forced, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place 
forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive. 
“It’s ideal for headquarters, of course,” Sirius said. “My father put 
every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived 
here. It’s Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if 
they’d have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protec-
tion, you’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s 
Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquar-
ters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody 
showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore. . . .” Sirius gave a 
short, barklike laugh. “If my parents could see the use it was being put 
to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait should give you some idea. . . .” 
He scowled for a moment, then sighed. 
“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do some-
thing useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your 
hearing — as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral 
support, what d’you think?” 
Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty 
carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the 
previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he 
liked best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had completely 
flown his mind. At Sirius’s words, however, the crushing sense of 
dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all 
tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they 
went back to Hogwarts without him. 
“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius 
had been watching him. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s 
definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about be-
ing allowed to use magic to save your own life.” 
“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I come back 
here and live with you?” 
Sirius smiled sadly. 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 116  
“We’ll see.” 
“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go 
back to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him. 
“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said Sirius gloomily. 
“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” Mrs. Weasley 
called. 
Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, 
and he and Harry went to join the others. 
Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emp-
tied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job 
that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there 
seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a 
bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had 
developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove. 
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tap-
ping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must 
be Wartcap powder in there.” 
He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing 
the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand 
carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already 
doxy-filled pocket. 
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something 
like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm 
like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his 
skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled 
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box 
that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all 
found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny 
had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket that none of 
them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a dusty box, an 
Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grand-
father for “Services to the Ministry.” 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 117  
“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius contemptuously, 
throwing the medal into the rubbish sack. 
Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to 
smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses 
every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden 
ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into 
furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling 
Sirius names Harry had never heard before. 
“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. 
“Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still 
caught him snogging a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.” 
 
Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. 
The drawing room took three days to decontaminate; finally the only 
undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, 
which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the 
rattling writing desk; Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so 
they could not be sure what was inside it. 
They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the 
ground floor where they found spiders large as saucers lurking in the 
dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not 
return for an hour and a half). The china, which bore the Black crest 
and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and 
the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames, 
all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them 
smashed. 
Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opin-
ion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a 
very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept 
appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming 
more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he 
could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 118  
with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, 
“Master must do as Master wishes,” before turning away and mutter-
ing very loudly, “but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because 
Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the 
Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum. . . .” 
At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by 
the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room. 
The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius’s 
mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to at-
tempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from 
the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to 
sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in 
and out of the house several times more, though to Harry’s relief they 
never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration 
teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress 
and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger. 
Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them 
for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old 
ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the 
house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious 
work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had 
developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby. 
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley’s eyes by res-
cuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to stran-
gle him when he removed them from their wardrobe. 
Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams 
about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry 
was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he 
was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever 
he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shad-
ows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry  
 
THE  NOBLE  AND MOST 
ANCIENT  HOUSE  OF  BLACK 
 119  
hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he 
wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The 
idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to 
Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering to-
gether and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in 
not mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination 
showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand 
in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys’ . . . but he would not 
go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grim-
mauld Place and live with Sirius. 
He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs. 
Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said 
quietly, “I’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, 
and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression 
can work wonders.” 
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and 
looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops, 
but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew. 
“How am I getting there?” he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound 
unconcerned. 
“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. Weasley gently. 
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table. 
“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the hearing,” he said. 
Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, 
Mrs. Weasley had answered it. 
“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea for Sirius to 
go with you, and I must say I —” 
“— think he’s quite right,” said Sirius through clenched teeth. 
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips. 
“When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Harry said, staring at 
Sirius. 
 
CHAPTER  SIX 
 120  
“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. Weasley. 
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry dropped his 
own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the 
house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him 
feel, if that were possible, even worse.

arry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and 
completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few 
moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every 
tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed 
and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered 
jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. 
The blank picture on the wall sniggered again. 
Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast 
asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto 
the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to 
think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer 
be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, 
past the heads of Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen. 
He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached 
the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and 
when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, 
and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him.

CHAPTER  SEVEN

All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, 
purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered. 
“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to 
the fire. 
“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and 
curly this morning. “Sleep all right?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry. 
“I’ve b-b-been up all night,” she said, with another shuddering 
yawn. “Come and sit down. . . .” 
She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process. 
“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. “Porridge? 
Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?” 
“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry. 
Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying 
about Scrimgeour?” 
“Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been 
asking Kingsley and me funny questions. . . .” 
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the 
conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a cou-
ple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, 
but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other 
side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and 
smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t. 
“. . . and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night duty tomor-
row, I’m just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, yawning hugely again. 
“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’m okay, I’ve got a report to 
finish anyway. . . .” 
Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a pair of pin-
striped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to 
Harry. 
“How are you feeling?” 
 
THE  MINISTRY  OF  MAGIC 
 123  
Harry shrugged. 
“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly. “In a few hours’ 
time you’ll be cleared.” 
Harry said nothing. 
“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones’s office. She’s Head of 
the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll 
be questioning you.” 
“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. “She’s fair, 
she’ll hear you out.” 
Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. 
“Don’t lose your temper,” said Sirius abruptly. “Be polite and stick 
to the facts.” 
Harry nodded again. 
“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly. “Even underage wiz-
ards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.” 
Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry’s neck; for a 
moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm 
on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his 
hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. 
“Doesn’t it ever lie flat?” she said desperately. 
Harry shook his head. 
Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. 
“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll 
be better off there than hanging around here.” 
“Okay,” said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to 
his feet. 
“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on the arm. 
“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.” 
“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia Bones for 
you. . . .” 
Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. 
 
CHAPTER  SEVEN 
 124  
“We’ve all got our fingers crossed,” she said. 
“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later then.” 
He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear 
Sirius’s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley 
unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn. 
“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” Harry asked him, as 
they set off briskly around the square. 
“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. Weasley, “but obviously you can’t, 
and I think it’s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . 
makes a better impression, given what you’re being disciplined for. . . .” 
Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry 
knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were 
almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Under-
ground station they found it already full of early morning commuters. 
As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going 
about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his 
enthusiasm. 
“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket 
machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.” 
“They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the sign. 
“Yes, but even so . . .” said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them. 
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard 
(Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good 
with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an 
Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London. 
Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Under-
ground map above the windows. 
“Four stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go, 
Harry . . .” 
They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from 
the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up  
 
THE  MINISTRY  OF  MAGIC 
 125  
the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley 
delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged 
onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already 
full of traffic. 
“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-
stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong sta-
tion despite Mr. Weasley’s continual references to the map; but a 
second later he said, “Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,” and led him down 
a side road. 
“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come by train and it all looks rather 
different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I’ve never 
even used the visitor’s entrance before.” 
The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the build-
ings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several 
rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. 
Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry 
of Magic. 
“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red 
telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood be-
fore a heavily graffittied wall. “After you, Harry.” 
He opened the telephone box door. 
Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. 
Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a 
tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which 
was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to 
rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver. 
“Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,” Harry said. 
“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver 
above his head and peering at the dial. “Let’s see . . . six . . .” he dialed 
the number, “two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another 
two . . .” 
 
CHAPTER  SEVEN 
 126  
As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice 
sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. 
Weasley’s hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible 
woman were standing right beside them. 
“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and 
business.” 
“Er . . .” said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk 
into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece 
to his ear, “Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here 
to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary 
hearing. . . .” 
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitor, please take the 
badge and attach it to the front of your robes.” 
There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out 
of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked 
it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hear-
ing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice 
spoke again. 
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and 
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is lo-
cated at the far end of the Atrium.” 
The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking 
slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pave-
ment rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until dark-
ness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could 
only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way 
down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much 
longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, 
widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to 
blink to stop his eyes from watering. 
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,” said the 
woman’s voice. 
THE  MINISTRY  OF  MAGIC 
 127  
The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley 
stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open. 
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a 
highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid 
with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and chang-
ing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side 
were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into 
them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of 
the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short 
queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart. 
Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, 
larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of 
them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight 
up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, 
a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up 
at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the 
ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the tip of 
the goblin’s hat, and each of the house-elf’s ears, so that the tinkling 
hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators 
and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most 
of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set 
of golden gates at the far end of the hall. 
“This way,” said Mr. Weasley. 
They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry 
workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, 
others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they 
walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and 
bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A 
small, smudged sign beside it read: 
 
All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to 
St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries 
CHAPTER  SEVEN 
 128  
If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry 
found himself thinking desperately. 
“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the 
stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a 
desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying security. A badly 
shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached 
and put down his Daily Prophet. 
“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry. 
“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice. 
Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden 
rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s 
front and back. 
“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the 
golden instrument and holding out his hand. 
Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange 
brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with 
only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came 
speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the 
writing upon it. 
“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That 
correct?” 
“Yes,” said Harry nervously. 
“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a 
small brass spike. “You get this back,” he added, thrusting the wand at 
Harry. 
“Thank you.” 
“Hang on. . . .” said the wizard slowly. 
His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on Harry’s chest 
to his forehead. 
“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by 
the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the 
stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates. 
THE  MINISTRY  OF  MAGIC 
 129  
Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through 
the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood 
behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the 
crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large 
cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises. 
“All right, Arthur?” said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley. 
“What’ve you got there, Bob?” asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the 
box. 
“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously. “We thought it was a 
bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a seri-
ous breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.” 
With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of 
them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved in-
side it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against 
the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at 
him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flat-
tening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the 
lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool 
female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again. 
“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorpo-
rating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official 
Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.” 
The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, 
with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the 
walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of 
broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down 
the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the 
woman’s voice said, “Level six, Department of Magical Transport, in-
corporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, 
Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.” 
Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and 
wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped 
CHAPTER  SEVEN 
 130  
into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around 
above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry 
of magic stamped along the edges of their wings. 
“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him. 
“We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all 
over the desks . . .” 
As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the 
swaying lamp in the lift’s ceiling. 
“Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, in-
corporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the 
International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confeder-
ation of Wizards, British Seats.” 
When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few 
more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that 
the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they 
darted around it. 
“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of 
Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, 
Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.” 
“ ’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and 
he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged 
shut yet again. 
“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, 
including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Head-
quarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.” 
Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and 
a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that 
was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar 
around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors 
opened and the voice said, “Level two, Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror 
Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.” 
THE  MINISTRY  OF  MAGIC 
 131  
“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch 
out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. “My office is on the 
other side of the floor.” 
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window through which 
sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?” 
“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted windows; 
Magical Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day. 
We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a 
pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.” 
They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, 
and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which 
were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out 
of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cu-
bicle read auror headquarters. 
Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. 
The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pic-
tures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters 
of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. 
A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill’s was sitting with 
his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther 
along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her 
cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. 
“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. 
“I’ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?” 
“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a 
hurry.” 
They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each 
other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. 
Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and 
into the very last cubicle. 
Harry received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was blinking down at 
him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs 
CHAPTER  SEVEN 
 132  
— even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding — 
papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world 
in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. 
“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of 
parchment into his hand, “I need as much information as possible on 
flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve re-
ceived information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.” 
Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, 
“Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.” Then he said in 
normal tones, “And don’t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that 
firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.” 
“If you had read my report you would know that the term is 
‘firearms,’ ” said Mr. Weasley coolly. “And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait 
for information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the mo-
ment.” He dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away before 
seven, Molly’s making meatballs.” 
He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s cubicle, 
through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, 
marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and dis-
tinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door 
on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the 
right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle 
artifacts. 
Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the 
broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was 
barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing 
cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. 
The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; 
there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, 
two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle 
children’s books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug. 
Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was an old 
THE  MINISTRY  OF  MAGIC 
 133  
toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty 
leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the 
Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy ap-
peared to have walked out of it. 
“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking 
off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. “We’ve 
asked, but they don’t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, 
doesn’t look as if Perkins is in yet.” 
Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins’s desk while 
Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shackle-
bolt had given him. 
“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine enti-
tled The Quibbler from its midst, “yes . . .” He flicked through it. 
“Yes, he’s right, I’m sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, 
what’s this now?” 
A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered 
to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and 
read aloud, “ ‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal 
Green, kindly investigate immediately.’ This is getting ridiculous. . . .” 
“A regurgitating toilet?” 
“Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had 
two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Mug-
gles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — 
well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those 
pumbles, I think they’re called — you know, the ones who mend pipes 
and things —” 
“Plumbers?” 
“— exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I only hope we 
can catch whoever’s doing it.” 
“Will it be Aurors who catch them?” 
“Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it’ll be the ordinary Magical 
Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.” 
CHAPTER  SEVEN 
 134  
A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just 
entered the room, panting. 
“Oh Arthur!” he said desperately, without looking at Harry. 
“Thank goodness, I didn’t know what to do for the best, whether to 
wait here for you or not, I’ve just sent an owl to your home but you’ve 
obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —” 
“I know about the regurgitating toilet,” said Mr. Weasley. 
“No, no, it’s not the toilet, it’s the Potter boy’s hearing — they’ve 
changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o’clock now and it’s 
down in old Courtroom Ten —” 
“Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard —” 
Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his 
chair. 
“Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!” 
Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley 
left the office at a run, Harry on his heels. 
“Why have they changed the time?” Harry said breathlessly as they 
hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and 
stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his in-
sides back at Perkins’s desk. 
“I’ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you’d 
missed it it would have been catastrophic!” 
Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impa-
tiently at the down button. 
“Come ON!” 
The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it 
stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number 
nine button. 
“Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years,” said Mr. Weasley 
angrily. “I can’t think why they’re doing it down there — unless — 
but no . . .” 
 
THE  MINISTRY  OF  MAGIC 
 135  
A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that 
moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate. 
“The Atrium,” said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid 
open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the 
fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with 
a very mournful face got in. 
“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to 
descend. “Don’t often see you down here. . . .” 
“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on 
the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry. 
“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. “Of course.” 
Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering 
gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable. 
“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, and left it at 
that. 
“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and 
they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The 
walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a 
plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected 
them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm 
and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a 
flight of steps. 
“Down here, down here,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at 
a time. “The lift doesn’t even come down this far . . . why they’re do-
ing it there . . .” 
They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another 
corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape’s 
dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. 
The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts 
and keyholes. 
“Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we’re nearly . . . yes.” 
 
CHAPTER  SEVEN

Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an 
immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch 
in his chest. 
“Go on,” he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. “Get in 
there.” 
“Aren’t — aren’t you coming with — ?” 
“No, no, I’m not allowed. Good luck!” 
Harry’s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam’s apple. 
He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped 
inside the courtroom.

THE HEARING 
 
 
 
arry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he 
had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it 
before, he had been here before: This was the place he had visited in-
side Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the place where he had watched the 
Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. 
The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty 
benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches 
of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low 
voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous 
silence fell. 
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom. 
“You’re late.” 
“Sorry,” said Harry nervously. “I-I didn’t know the time had 
changed.” 
“That is not the Wizengamot’s fault,” said the voice. “An owl was 
sent to you this morning. Take your seat.” 
Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the 
arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring 
H 
CHAPTER  EIGHT

to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed 
loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the 
edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not 
bind him. Feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the 
bench above. 
There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing 
plum-colored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-
hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some 
with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity. 
In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Min-
ister of Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green 
bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed 
too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to 
Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on 
Fudge’s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge’s 
right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench 
that her face was in shadow. 
“Very well,” said Fudge. “The accused being present — finally — 
let us begin. Are you ready?” he called down the row. 
“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron’s brother Percy was 
sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, ex-
pecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy’s 
eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a 
quill poised in his hand. 
“Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,” said Fudge in a 
ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, “into offenses 
committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Un-
derage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry 
James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, 
Surrey. 
“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic;

Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —” 
“— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumble-
dore,” said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so 
fast he cricked his neck. 
Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long 
midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver 
beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry 
and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested 
halfway down his very crooked nose. 
The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were 
now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly fright-
ened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands 
and waved in welcome. 
A powerful emotion had risen in Harry’s chest at the sight of Dum-
bledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix 
song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumble-
dore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the 
obviously flustered Fudge. 
“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. “Dumble-
dore. Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and — 
er — place of the hearing had been changed, then?” 
“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However, 
due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so 
no harm done.” 
“Yes — well — I suppose we’ll need another chair — I — 
Weasley, could you — ?” 
“Not to worry, not to worry,” said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took 
out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair ap-
peared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the 
tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with 
an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering 
CHAPTER  EIGHT 
 140  
and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle 
down. 
“Yes,” said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. “Well, then. So. The 
charges. Yes.” 
He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took 
a deep breath, and read, “The charges against the accused are as fol-
lows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the 
illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning 
from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus 
Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on 
August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which consti-
tutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable 
Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thir-
teen of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy. 
“You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little 
Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his 
parchment. 
“Yes,” Harry said. 
“You received an official warning from the Ministry for using ille-
gal magic three years ago, did you not?” 
“Yes, but —” 
“And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of 
August?” said Fudge. 
“Yes,” said Harry, “but —” 
“Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school 
while you are under the age of seventeen?” 
“Yes, but —” 
“Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?” 
“Yes, but —” 
“Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the 
time? 
“Yes,” said Harry angrily, “but I only used it because we were —” 
THE  HEARING 
 141  
The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a 
booming voice. 
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —” 
“A corporeal Patronus?” 
“A — what?” said Harry. 
“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was 
more than vapor or smoke?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, 
“it’s a stag, it’s always a stag.” 
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus 
before now?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —” 
“And you are fifteen years old?” 
“Yes, and —” 
“You learned this at school?” 
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —” 
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true 
Patronus at that age . . . very impressive indeed.” 
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; 
a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads. 
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” said Fudge 
in a testy voice. “In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would 
have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!” 
Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but 
it was the sight of Percy’s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry 
into speech. 
“I did it because of the dementors!” he said loudly, before anyone 
could interrupt him again. 
He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed 
to be somehow denser than before. 
“Dementors?” said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick 
CHAPTER  EIGHT 
 142  
eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. “What 
do you mean, boy?” 
“I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they 
went for me and my cousin!” 
“Ah,” said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around 
at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. “Yes. 
Yes, I thought we’d be hearing something like this.” 
“Dementors in Little Whinging?” Madam Bones said in tones of 
great surprise. “I don’t understand —” 
“Don’t you, Amelia?” said Fudge, still smirking. “Let me explain. 
He’s been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a 
very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can’t see demen-
tors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it’s 
just your word and no witnesses. . . .” 
“I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of mut-
tering from the court. “There were two of them, coming from oppo-
site ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin 
felt them and ran for it —” 
“Enough, enough!” said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his 
face. “I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very 
well-rehearsed story —” 
Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again. 
“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that 
alleyway,” he said, “other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.” 
Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let 
air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, 
then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, 
said, “We haven’t got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid, 
Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly —” 
“I may be wrong,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but I am sure that 
under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to

present witnesses for his or her case? Isn’t that the policy of the De-
partment of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?” he contin-
ued, addressing the witch in the monocle. 
“True,” said Madam Bones. “Perfectly true.” 
“Oh, very well, very well,” snapped Fudge. “Where is this person?” 
“I brought her with me,” said Dumbledore. “She’s just outside the 
door. Should I — ?” 
“No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at 
once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge’s balcony, and has-
tened past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them. 
A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked 
scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to 
change out of her carpet slippers. 
Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a 
second one for himself. 
“Full name?” said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched her-
self nervously on the very edge of her seat. 
“Arabella Doreen Figg,” said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice. 
“And who exactly are you?” said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice. 
“I’m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter 
lives,” said Mrs. Figg. 
“We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whing-
ing other than Harry Potter,” said Madam Bones at once. “That situ-
ation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.” 
“I’m a Squib,” said Mrs. Figg. “So you wouldn’t have me registered, 
would you?” 
“A Squib, eh?” said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. “We’ll be check-
ing that. You’ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, 
Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking 
left and right along the bench where he sat. 
“Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly. 
 
CHAPTER  EIGHT 
 144  
Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. “Very well,” 
he said coolly. “What is your story?” 
“I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of 
Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of 
August,” gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what 
she was saying by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the alley-
way between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching 
the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running —” 
“Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don’t run, 
they glide.” 
“That’s what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of 
pink appearing in her withered cheeks. “Gliding along the alley to-
ward what looked like two boys.” 
“What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes 
so that the monocle’s edges disappeared into her flesh. 
“Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny —” 
“No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors . . . de-
scribe them.” 
“Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. 
“They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.” 
Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever 
Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most 
she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could 
never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way 
they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of 
them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the 
surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in 
the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and 
whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded. 
“Big and wearing cloaks,” repeated Madam Bones coolly, while 
Fudge snorted derisively. “I see. Anything else?” 
 
THE  HEARING 
 145  
“Yes,” said Mrs. Figg. “I felt them. Everything went cold, and this 
was a very warm summer’s night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though 
all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . 
dreadful things. . . .” 
Her voice shook and died. 
Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks 
under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it. 
“What did the dementors do?” she asked, and Harry felt a rush of 
hope. 
“They went for the boys,” said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and 
more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. “One 
of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the 
dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor. 
On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down 
the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the 
second from his cousin. And that . . . that was what happened,” Mrs. 
Figg finished, somewhat lamely. 
Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not 
looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his 
eyes and said, rather aggressively “That’s what you saw, is it?” 
“That was what happened,” Mrs. Figg repeated. 
“Very well,” said Fudge. “You may go.” 
Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then 
got up and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud 
shut behind her. 
“Not a very convincing witness,” said Fudge loftily. 
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bones in her booming voice. “She 
certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. 
And I can’t imagine why she would say they were there if they 
weren’t —” 
“But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening  
 
CHAPTER  EIGHT 
 146  
to come across a wizard?” snorted Fudge. “The odds on that must be 
very, very long, even Bagman wouldn’t have bet —” 
“Oh, I don’t think any of us believe the dementors were there by 
coincidence,” said Dumbledore lightly. 
The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow 
moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent. 
“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge icily. 
“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore. 
“I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair 
of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!” barked Fudge. 
“Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than 
the Ministry of Magic these days,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have 
already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.” 
“Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to be-
lieve that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The 
dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we 
ask them to.” 
“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask our-
selves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors 
into that alleyway on the second of August.” 
In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the 
right of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time. 
He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather 
squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a 
very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly 
bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short 
curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a 
long sticky tongue. 
“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecre-
tary to the Minister,” said Fudge. 
The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took 
Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak. 
THE  HEARING 
 147  
“I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,” 
she said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. “So 
silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were sug-
gesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!” 
She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s 
neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with 
her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really 
amused. 
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Min-
istry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry 
and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at 
the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore po-
litely. “Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside 
Ministry control —” 
“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” snapped 
Fudge, who had turned brick red. 
Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow. 
“Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into 
why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they at-
tacked without authorization.” 
“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does 
not do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of 
which Uncle Vernon would have been proud. 
“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was merely ex-
pressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.” 
He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and 
stared back at him, frowning slightly. 
“I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, 
if indeed they are not figments of this boy’s imagination, is not the 
subject of this hearing!” said Fudge. “We are here to examine Harry 
Potter’s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of 
Underage Sorcery!” 
CHAPTER  EIGHT 
 148  
“Of course we are,” said Dumbledore, “but the presence of demen-
tors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree 
states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circum-
stances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that 
threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or 
Muggles present at the time of the —” 
“We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!” snarled 
Fudge. 
“Of course you are,” said Dumbledore courteously. “Then we are 
in agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circum-
stances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it 
describes?” 
“If there were dementors, which I doubt —” 
“You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore interrupted. “If 
you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am 
sure she would not object.” 
“I — that — not —” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers be-
fore him. “It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!” 
“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard 
from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,” 
said Dumbledore. 
“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice. 
“Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull sto-
ries this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up 
his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten 
the Hover Charm he used three years ago —” 
“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry. 
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s di-
rection. “A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —” 
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts 
School,” said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to 
give evidence if you wish.” 
THE  HEARING 
 149  
“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, 
that’s not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge 
shouted, banging his fist on the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle 
of ink. 
“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, ac-
cepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control 
their emotions,” said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to 
scrub the ink off his notes. 
“And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at school —” 
“— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts 
students for misdemeanors at school, Harry’s behavior there is not rel-
evant to this inquiry,” said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now 
with a suggestion of coolness behind his words. 
“Oho!” said Fudge. “Not our business what he does at school, eh? 
You think so?” 
“The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts stu-
dents, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of 
August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate 
wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I re-
minded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable 
haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am 
sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.” 
“Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely. 
“Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And 
you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in 
the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has 
already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a 
simple matter of underage magic!” 
A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their 
seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike 
witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face 
quite expressionless. 
CHAPTER  EIGHT 
 150  
“As far as I am aware, however,” Dumbledore continued, “there is 
no law yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish Harry for 
every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a 
specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do 
now is to await your verdict.” 
Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. 
Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at 
Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumble-
dore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about 
time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed 
oblivious to Harry’s attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up 
at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, 
whispered conversations. 
Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen 
to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had ex-
pected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that 
he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He 
ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how 
he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been 
kissed. . . . 
Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but 
his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times 
he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes. 
Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the 
judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep exam-
ining his laces. 
“Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?” said Madam 
Bones’s booming voice. 
Harry’s head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of 
them . . . more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but 
before he could finish Madam Bones had said, “And those in favor of 
conviction?” 
THE  HEARING 
 151  
Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the 
witch on his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzy-
haired witch in the second row. 
Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was 
something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He 
took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by sup-
pressed rage, “Very well, very well . . . cleared of all charges.” 
“Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling 
out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. “Well, I 
must be getting along. Good day to you all.” 
And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.

umbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry completely by sur-
prise. He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, 
struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were 
all getting to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and 
packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying 
him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s 
right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ig-
noring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting 
to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined 
not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, 
so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody 
called him back, broke into a very fast walk. 
He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and al-
most collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside, 
looking pale and apprehensive. 
“Dumbledore didn’t say —” 
“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, “of all 
charges!” 
D 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 153  
Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders. 
“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t have found 
you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t —” 
But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just 
opened again. The Wizengamot were filing out. 
“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry 
aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?” 
“I think so,” said Harry quietly. 
One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed 
and a few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. 
Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toad-
like witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as 
though Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the 
witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to 
pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and 
Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a 
handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines 
around Mr. Weasley’s mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he 
gave no sign that he had noticed his third son. 
“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the 
good news,” he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy’s heels disap-
peared up the stairs to the ninth level. I’ll drop you off on the way to 
that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on. . . .” 
“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grin-
ning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It 
was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts. 
“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they 
mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage, 
it’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting 
might strike some wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of some-
thing much deeper and nastier, and I for one —” 
Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 154  
ninth-level corridor, and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet 
away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair 
and a pointed, pale face. 
The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too 
broke off in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed 
upon Harry’s face. 
“Well, well, well . . . Patronus Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy coolly. 
Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something 
heavy. He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death 
Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark grave-
yard while Lord Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that 
Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he 
was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talk-
ing to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy 
was a Death Eater. 
“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,” 
drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to 
wriggle out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .” 
Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning. 
“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping. . . .” 
Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face. 
“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?” 
“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. 
“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glanc-
ing toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were 
up on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves 
sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?” 
“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s 
shoulder. 
“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy. 
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are 
any concern of yours, Potter,” said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his

robes; Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like 
a full pocket of gold. “Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s fa-
vorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of 
us. . . . Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?” 
“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr. 
Weasley. “This way, Lucius.” 
They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not 
let go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift. 
“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got busi-
ness to do together?” Harry burst out furiously. “What was he doing 
down here?” 
“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,” said Mr. 
Weasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as 
though making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out 
whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore 
when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge 
again.” 
“What private business have they got together anyway?” 
“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving 
generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the 
right people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want 
passed . . . Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy. . . .” 
The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that 
flapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the 
Atrium and the doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably. 
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death 
Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they 
haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him?” 
“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” muttered Mr. 
Weasley. “But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord 
at the moment — which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. 
. . . Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry. . . .” 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 156  
The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-
deserted Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily 
Prophet again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain be-
fore Harry remembered. 
“Wait. . . .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from 
his pocket, he turned back to the fountain. 
He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry 
thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a 
vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of 
goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this 
soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of 
creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of 
what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry 
turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten 
Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet. 
 
“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always get away with 
stuff!” 
“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked 
positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and 
was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case 
against you, none at all. . . .” 
“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew 
I’d get off,” said Harry, smiling. 
Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, 
and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He 
got off, he got off, he got off —” 
“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too 
was smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry —” 
“What?” said Sirius sharply. 
“He got off, he got off, he got off —” 
“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY

nine, then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought 
to know.” 
“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.” 
“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal 
Green waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but 
Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner —” 
“He got off, he got off, he got off —” 
“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley, 
as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. “Harry dear, come and sit down, have 
some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast. . . .” 
Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking 
happier than they had done since he had first arrived at number 
twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Harry’s feeling of giddy relief, which 
had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, 
swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcom-
ing all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his 
snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the 
noise. 
“ ’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no 
way they were going to convict you,” said Ron happily, now dishing 
great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates. 
“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it would sound 
highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked 
to me, though. Or even looked at me.” 
And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly 
that he clapped his hand to it. 
“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed. 
“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the 
time now. . . .” 
None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now help-
ing themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape; 
Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 158  
anxious, but before she could say anything, Ron said happily, “I bet 
Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.” 
“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a 
huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. “He’s really very 
busy at the moment.” 
“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —” 
“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley. 
 
Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was 
one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not 
seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sir-
ius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the 
news, wringing Harry’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them; 
soon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to 
everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut 
up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak. 
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry 
had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they 
scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later. 
“You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s 
being selfish.” 
“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he at-
tempted to prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his 
finger, “you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without 
company.” 
“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the 
Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry 
would be coming to live here with him.” 
“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He 
wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.” 
“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said 
Hermione wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 159  
think a part of him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d 
both be outcasts together.” 
“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely 
shrugged. 
“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sir-
ius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.” 
“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly. 
“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said 
Hermione simply. 
At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them. 
“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the cupboard. 
“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!” said Ron 
bitterly. “D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we ar-
rived here?” 
“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can 
do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.” 
“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron. 
“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, per-
haps you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully, 
as Mrs. Weasley left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t 
be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the 
time — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, 
all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds —” 
“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron muttered irritably, 
but only so Harry could hear him. 
Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more 
as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid 
again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to 
the Herbology greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty, 
musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and 
Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though 
Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius. 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 160  
The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort 
movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would 
have expected before he’d experienced it. Though members of the Or-
der of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for 
meals, sometimes only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation, 
Mrs. Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out 
of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sir-
ius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he 
had heard on the night of his arrival. 
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hed-
wig’s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered 
their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes. 
“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up 
to Harry, who was standing on a chair. “About time, I thought they’d 
forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this. . . .” 
Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw 
the bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, 
which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It 
contained two pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term 
started on the first of September, the other telling him which books he 
would need for the coming year. 
“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The Standard Book 
of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, 
by Wilbert Slinkhard.” 
Crack. 
Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to 
them doing this by now that he didn’t even fall off his chair. 
“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said 
Fred conversationally. 
“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the 
Dark Arts teacher,” said George. 
 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 161  
“And about time too,” said Fred. 
“What d’you mean?” Harry asked, jumping down beside them. 
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears 
a few weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying, 
Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this 
year.” 
“Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last 
four?” said George. 
“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in 
a trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fin-
gers. “Yeah, I see what you mean.” 
“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred. 
Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very 
still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts. 
“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to 
look over his shoulder at the parchment. 
Fred’s mouth fell open too. 
“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter. “Prefect?” 
George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s other hand, and 
turned it upside down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into 
George’s palm. 
“No way,” said George in a hushed voice. 
“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the letter out of 
Ron’s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a wa-
termark. “No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect. . . .” 
The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at 
Harry. 
“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that suggested 
Harry had tricked them in some way. 
“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George 
indignantly. 
 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 162  
“Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred. 
“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him,” said 
George to Fred. 
“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, you’ve caused too much trouble, 
mate. Well, at least one of you’s got their priorities right.” 
He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving 
Ron a scathing look. 
“Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the prefect . . .” 
“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the 
prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him. 
Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for 
a moment, and then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for 
confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was super-
imposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on 
Percy’s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts. 
The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her 
cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand. 
“Did you — did you get — ?” 
She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a shriek. 
“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too, 
Harry, me too!” 
“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron’s hand. 
“It’s Ron, not me.” 
“It — what?” 
“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said. 
“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I 
mean —” 
She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expres-
sion on his face. 
“It’s my name on the letter,” he said. 
“I . . .” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. “I . . . well 
. . . wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really —” 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 163  
“Unexpected,” said George, nodding. 
“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not . . . 
Ron’s done loads of . . . he’s really . . .” 
The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley 
backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes. 
“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, glancing 
around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and 
started sorting the robes into two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll 
take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books 
while you’re packing. Ron, I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are 
at least six inches too short, I can’t believe how fast you’re growing . . . 
what color would you like?” 
“Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said George, smirking. 
“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of 
maroon socks and placing them on Ron’s pile. 
“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over 
quickly. “His lovely shiny new prefect’s badge.” 
Fred’s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley’s preoccu-
pation about pajamas. 
“His . . . but . . . Ron, you’re not. . . ?” 
Ron held up his badge. 
Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s. 
“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A 
prefect! That’s everyone in the family!” 
“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said George indig-
nantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her 
youngest son. 
“Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what won-
derful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s 
the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this 
worry, I’m just thrilled, oh Ronnie —” 
Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind

her back but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron’s 
neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter 
scarlet than his badge. 
“Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a grip. . . .” he muttered, trying to 
push her away. 
She let go of him and said breathlessly, “Well, what will it be? We 
gave Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course.” 
“W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though he did not 
dare believe his ears. 
“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly. 
“How about a nice new set of dress robes?” 
“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, who looked as 
though he sincerely regretted this generosity. 
“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new 
rat, you always liked Scabbers —” 
“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new broom?” 
Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive. 
“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add. “Just — just a new 
one for a change . . .” 
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled. 
“Of course you can. . . . Well, I’d better get going if I’ve got a broom 
to buy too. I’ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t 
forget to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh, I’m all of a dither!” 
She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bus-
tled from the room. 
Fred and George exchanged looks. 
“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a 
falsely anxious voice. 
“We could curtsy, if you like,” said George. 
“Oh, shut up,” said Ron, scowling at them. 
“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. “Going 
to put us in detention?” 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 165  
“I’d love to see him try,” sniggered George. 
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which 
Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it, 
Hermione.” 
“We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said Fred, pre-
tending to tremble, “with these two on our case. . . .” 
“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said 
George, shaking his head. 
And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated. 
“Those two!” said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, 
through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with 
laughter in the room upstairs. “Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron, 
they’re only jealous!” 
“I don’t think they are,” said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the 
ceiling. “They’ve always said only prats become prefects. . . . Still,” he 
added on a happier note, “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I 
could go with Mum and choose. . . . She’ll never be able to afford a 
Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . . 
Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she 
knows. . . .” 
He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. 
For some reason, Harry found that he did not want to look at 
Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes 
Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk. 
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively. 
“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice 
at all, and still not looking at her. “Brilliant. Prefect. Great.” 
“Thanks,” said Hermione. “Erm — Harry — could I borrow 
Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I 
mean, prefect is something they can understand —” 
“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice 
that did not belong to him. “Take her!” 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 166  
He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and pre-
tended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the 
wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry 
heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only 
sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again 
and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings. 
He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hed-
wig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gaz-
ing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe. 
He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the 
fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being ex-
pelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging 
their way toward certain people. But if he had remembered . . . if he 
had thought about it . . . what would he have expected? 
Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head. 
Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not 
lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he 
would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him 
as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to every-
one else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron? 
No, said the small voice defiantly. 
Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings. 
I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I’m not better at anything 
else. 
That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron 
in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adven-
tures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started 
at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion? 
Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice 
in Harry’s head. 
Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn’t fight  
 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 167  
Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t 
get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in that 
graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. . . . 
And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on 
the night he had arrived rose again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry 
thought indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them! 
But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t 
choose prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situ-
ations. . . . Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. . . . Ron must have 
something you don’t. . . . 
Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the ward-
robe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said. 
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect. . . .” 
Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened 
with himself. 
Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This 
was not Ron’s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron’s best friend in the world, 
going to sulk because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins 
behind Ron’s back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had 
beaten Harry at something? 
At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again. He 
stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as 
Ron bounded back through the door. 
“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the Clean-
sweep if she can.” 
“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had 
stopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron — well done, mate.” 
The smile faded off Ron’s face. 
“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his head, “I 
thought it would be you!” 
“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, echoing Fred. 
 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 168  
“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our 
trunks packed, hadn’t we?” 
It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered 
themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon 
to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and 
stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron 
kept moving his prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside 
table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lay-
ing it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the 
black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach 
it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it 
tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk. 
Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden 
with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown pa-
per that Ron took from her with a moan of longing. 
“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I 
want you all downstairs,” she said, but the moment she was out of 
sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of 
his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face. 
Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner 
over the heavily laden dinner table, which read congratulations 
ron and hermione — new prefects. She looked in a better mood 
than Harry had seen her all holiday. 
“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the 
room. “Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both 
owls and they’re thrilled,” she added, beaming. 
Fred rolled his eyes. 
Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there 
and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself 
a butterbeer. 
“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here,” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as

Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cloak. “We’ve been wanting to ask 
you for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the draw-
ing room and tell us what’s inside it? We haven’t wanted to open it just 
in case it’s something really nasty.” 
“No problem, Molly . . .” 
Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly 
through the ceiling of the kitchen. 
“Drawing room . . .” he growled, as the pupil contracted. “Desk in 
the corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it’s a boggart. . . . Want me to go 
up and get rid of it, Molly?” 
“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have 
your drink. We’re having a little bit of a celebration, actually. . . .” She 
gestured at the scarlet banner. “Fourth prefect in the family!” she said 
fondly, ruffling Ron’s hair. 
“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his mag-
ical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had 
the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away 
toward Sirius and Lupin. 
“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his 
normal eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose 
Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he 
wouldn’t have appointed you. . . .” 
Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved 
the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest 
brother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even 
complain that they had brought Mundungus with them too; he was 
wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places 
and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody’s traveling 
cloak. 
“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone 
had a drink. He raised his goblet. “To Ron and Hermione, the new 
Gryffindor prefects!” 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 170  
Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then 
applauded. 
“I was never a prefect myself,” said Tonks brightly from behind 
Harry as everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to 
food. Her hair was tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like 
Ginny’s older sister. “My Head of House said I lacked certain neces-
sary qualities.” 
“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato. 
“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks. 
Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know 
whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large 
gulp of butterbeer and choking on it. 
“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on 
the back. 
Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual barklike laugh. 
“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in 
detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.” 
“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to ex-
ercise some control over my best friends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely 
say that I failed dismally.” 
Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect ei-
ther. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up 
his plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room. 
Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would 
listen. 
“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you 
think the Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a 
decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?” 
Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf 
rights. 
“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation,  
 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 171  
isn’t it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking 
they’re superior to other creatures. . . .” 
Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill’s 
hair. 
“. . . getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-looking, it 
would look much better shorter, wouldn’t it, Harry?” 
“Oh — I dunno —” said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his 
opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, 
who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus. 
Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked 
and beckoned Harry closer. 
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, he’s our fi-
nancial backer.” 
“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand 
to Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint 
rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were com-
pletely stationary. 
“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need them for the 
Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so 
we’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.” 
“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred. 
“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said Mundungus, his 
saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m 
not taking a Knut under twenty.” 
“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry. 
“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl 
quills,” said George. 
“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly. 
“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re 
okay.” 
“But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed out. 
 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 172  
Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder. 
“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All right, lads, ten it is, if you’ll 
take ’em quick.” 
“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had 
emptied his pockets into the twins’ outstretched hands and scuttled 
off toward the food. “We’d better get these upstairs. . . .” 
Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just oc-
curred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how 
Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was 
inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Tri-
wizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but 
what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement? 
Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she 
found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a ca-
reer she thought quite unsuitable? 
Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty 
weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound 
of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even 
over the surrounding chatter. 
“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said Kingsley. 
“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin. 
“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,” 
persisted Kingsley, “ ’specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at 
him every few days. . . .” 
Harry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to 
know he had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table, 
though not remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated 
as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed. 
Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained 
of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because 
he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.

“. . . the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and 
in-built vibration control —” Ron was saying to Tonks. 
Mrs. Weasley yawned widely. 
“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur, 
I don’t want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry, dear.” 
She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered 
whether he could follow her without attracting attention. 
“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody. 
“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry. 
Moody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue eye staring 
sideways at Harry. 
“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you,” he said. 
From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old 
Wizarding photograph. 
“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody. “Found it last 
night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as 
Podmore hasn’t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought 
people might like to see it.” 
Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving 
at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him. 
“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The 
Moody in the picture was unmistakable, though his hair was slightly 
less gray and his nose was intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me, 
Dedalus Diggle on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she 
was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family. 
That’s Frank and Alice Longbottom —” 
Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at 
Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even 
though he had never met her, because she was the image of her son, 
Neville. 
“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what happened  
 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 174  
to them . . . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that 
there’s Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only 
ever found bits of him . . . shift aside there,” he added, poking the pic-
ture, and the little photographic people edged sideways, so that those 
who were partially obscured could move to the front. 
“That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and 
his family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he 
looks young . . . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we 
never found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as 
ever . . . Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear 
that stupid hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill 
him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along, 
budge along . . .” 
The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves, and 
those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture. 
“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him, 
strange bloke . . . That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her per-
sonally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you 
go, thought that would interest you!” 
Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up 
at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry rec-
ognized at once as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their 
whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths. 
“Eh?” said Moody. 
Harry looked up into Moody’s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evi-
dently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit 
of a treat. 
“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er . . . listen, I’ve 
just remembered, I haven’t packed my . . .” 
He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not 
packed; Sirius had just said, “What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?” 
and Moody had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen, 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 175  
slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call 
him back. 
He did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his 
parents’ pictures before, after all, and he had met Wormtail . . . but to 
have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it . . . 
No one would like that, he thought angrily. . . . 
And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces 
. . . Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, 
who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tor-
tured into madness . . . all waving happily out of the photograph 
forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed. . . . Well, Moody 
might find that interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . . 
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads, 
glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he 
heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room. 
“Hello?” Harry said. 
There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the 
remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened 
the drawing-room door. 
Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her 
hand, her whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old 
carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron. 
All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he 
were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead, 
no, it couldn’t be — 
But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs — 
“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry croaked. 
“R-r-riddikulus!’’ Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand 
at Ron’s body. 
Crack. 
Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes 
wide open and empty. Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 176  
“R-riddikulus!” she sobbed again. 
Crack. 
Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s, his glasses askew, a trickle of 
blood running down his face. 
“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No . . . riddikulus! Riddikulus! 
RIDDIKULUS!” 
Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . . 
“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, staring down 
at his own dead body on the floor. “Let someone else —” 
“What’s going on?” 
Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, 
with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs. 
Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in 
an instant. Pulling out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly, 
“Riddikulus!” 
Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot 
where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb van-
ished in a puff of smoke. 
“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a 
storm of crying, her face in her hands. 
“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t . . .” 
Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s shoulder. 
“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, patting her on the 
head. “Just a stupid boggart . . .” 
“I see them d-d-dead all the time!” Mrs. Weasley moaned into his 
shoulder. “All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . .” 
Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pre-
tending to be Harry’s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, 
who avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody’s magical eye 
had followed him all the way out of the kitchen. 
“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping  
 
THE  WOES  OF 
MRS.  WEASLEY 
 177  
her eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I d-d-don’t want him to know. . . . 
Being silly . . .” 
Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose. 
“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she said shakily. 
“Not even able to get rid of a boggart . . .” 
“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile. 
“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of her eyes 
again. “Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all 
come through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’s not talking to us. . . . What if 
something d-d-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up? 
And what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going 
to look after Ron and Ginny?” 
“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly. “This isn’t like last time. 
The Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what 
Voldemort’s up to —” 
Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name. 
“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it — 
look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise 
that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in 
the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered 
twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by 
one. . . .” 
Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents’ beaming 
faces. He knew Moody was still watching him. 
“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly. “He’ll come round. 
It’s a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he 
does, the whole Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them. 
And I’m not sure I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added bitterly. 
“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and 
Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d 
do, let them starve?” 
 
CHAPTER  NINE 
 178  
Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously. 
“Being silly,” she muttered again, mopping her eyes. 
But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes 
later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents 
beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that 
their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. 
The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. 
Weasley’s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes. 
Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again 
and his stomach churned horribly. 
“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded 
again. 
“First sign of madness, talking to your own head,” said a sly voice 
from the empty picture on the wall. 
Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and 
it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been 
worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.

arry had a troubled night’s sleep. His parents wove in and out 
of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over 
Kreacher’s dead body watched by Ron and Hermione, who were wear-
ing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corri-
dor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar 
prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him. 
“. . . better hurry up, Mum’s going ballistic, she says we’re going to 
miss the train. . . .” 
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as 
he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had be-
witched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying 
them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and 
knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and 
Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices. 
“— COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU 
IDIOTS —” 
“— FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE 
OF MY FATHERS —”

Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as 
Harry was putting on his trainers; Hedwig was swaying on her shoul-
der, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms. 
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl fluttered oblig-
ingly over and perched on top of her cage — “are you ready yet?” 
“Nearly — Ginny all right?” Harry asked, shoving on his glasses. 
“Mrs. Weasley’s patched her up,” said Hermione. “But now Mad-
Eye’s complaining that we can’t leave unless Sturgis Podmore’s here, 
otherwise the guard will be one short.” 
“Guard?” said Harry. “We have to go to King’s Cross with a guard?” 
“You have to go to King’s Cross with a guard,” Hermione corrected 
him. 
“Why?” said Harry irritably. “I thought Voldemort was supposed 
to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s going to jump out from 
behind a dustbin to try and do me in?” 
“I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said Hermione 
distractedly, looking at her watch. “But if we don’t leave soon we’re 
definitely going to miss the train. . . .” 
“WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!” Mrs. 
Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and 
hurried out of the room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremo-
niously into her cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging 
his trunk. 
Mrs. Black’s portrait was howling with rage but nobody was both-
ering to close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound 
to rouse her again anyway. 
“Harry, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted Mrs. Weasley 
over the repeated screeches of “MUDBLOODS! SCUM! CREATURES 
OF DIRT !” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with 
the luggage. . . . Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!” 
A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as Harry clam- 
 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 181  
bered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. 
Weasley. 
“Oh honestly . . .” said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, “well, on your 
own head be it!” 
She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak 
September sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door 
slammed behind them and Mrs. Black’s screeches were cut off 
instantly. 
“Where’s Tonks?” Harry said, looking around as they went down 
the stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they 
reached the pavement. 
“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, avert-
ing her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry. 
An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled 
gray hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a porkpie. 
“Wotcher, Harry,” she said, winking. “Better hurry up, hadn’t we, 
Molly?” she added, checking her watch. 
“I know, I know,” moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening her stride, 
“but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis. . . . If only Arthur could 
have got us cars from the Ministry again . . . but Fudge wouldn’t let 
him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days. . . . How 
Muggles can stand traveling without magic . . .” 
But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gamboled around 
them, snapping at pigeons, and chasing its own tail. Harry couldn’t 
help laughing. Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. 
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way. 
It took them twenty minutes to reach King’s Cross by foot and 
nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring 
a couple of cats for Harry’s entertainment. Once inside the station 
they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and 
ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in  
 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 182  
turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarters, 
where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a plat-
form packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled 
the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really going 
back. . . . 
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, 
staring behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, 
through which new arrivals would come. 
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks. 
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail 
frantically. 
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor 
with the luggage, look . . .” 
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came 
limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks. 
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think 
we were followed. . . .” 
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron 
and Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart 
when Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin. 
“No trouble?” growled Moody. 
“Nothing,” said Lupin. 
“I’ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,” said Moody. “That’s 
the second time he’s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as 
Mundungus.” 
“Well, look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round. 
He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. “You too, 
Harry. Be careful.” 
“Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,” said Moody, 
shaking Harry’s hand too. “And don’t forget, all of you — careful 
what you put in writing. If in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all.” 
 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 183  
“It’s been great meeting all of you,” said Tonks, hugging Hermione 
and Ginny. “We’ll see you soon, I expect.” 
A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform 
started hurrying onto the train. 
“Quick, quick,” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at ran-
dom and catching Harry twice. “Write. . . . Be good. . . . If you’ve for-
gotten anything we’ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry. . . .” 
For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs 
and placed its front paws on Harry’s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley 
shoved Harry away toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake 
act more like a dog, Sirius!” 
“See you!” Harry called out of the open window as the train began 
to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The 
figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank 
rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wag-
ging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it 
chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was 
gone. 
“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a worried 
voice. 
“Oh lighten up,” said Ron, “he hasn’t seen daylight for months, 
poor bloke.” 
“Well,” said Fred, clapping his hands together, “can’t stand around 
chatting all day, we’ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,” 
and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right. 
The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside 
the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood. 
“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” Harry asked Ron and 
Hermione. 
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks. 
“Er,” said Ron. 
 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 184  
“We’re — well — Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect 
carriage,” Hermione said awkwardly. 
Ron wasn’t looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely 
interested in the fingernails on his left hand. 
“Oh,” said Harry. “Right. Fine.” 
“I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione 
quickly. “Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy 
and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.” 
“Fine,” said Harry again. “Well, I-I might see you later, then.” 
“Yeah, definitely,” said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry. 
“It’s a pain having to go down there, I’d rather — but we have to — I 
mean, I’m not enjoying it, I’m not Percy,” he finished defiantly. 
“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione 
and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon 
off toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. 
He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron. 
“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to 
save them places.” 
“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the 
handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor, 
peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they 
passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a 
lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of 
them nudged their neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met 
this behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the 
Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying 
show-off he was. He wondered bleakly whether the people now star-
ing and whispering believed the stories. 
In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry’s fel-
low fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of 
pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his 
struggling toad, Trevor. 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 185  
“Hi, Harry,” he panted. “Hi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere’s full. . . . I 
can’t find a seat. . . .” 
“What are you talking about?” said Ginny, who had squeezed past 
Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. “There’s room in 
this one, there’s only Loony Lovegood in here —” 
Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone. 
“Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.” 
She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and 
Neville followed. 
“Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it okay if we take these seats?” 
The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-
length, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes 
that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why 
Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an 
aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her 
wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to 
wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine 
upside down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. 
She nodded. 
“Thanks,” said Ginny, smiling at her. 
Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig’s cage in 
the luggage rack and sat down. The girl called Luna watched them 
over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She 
did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared 
and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now 
wished he had not. 
“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked. 
“Yes,” said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. “Yes, 
it was quite enjoyable, you know. You’re Harry Potter,” she added. 
“I know I am,” said Harry. 
Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes upon him instead. 
“And I don’t know who you are.” 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 186  
“I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly. 
“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply. “Neville Longbottom — 
Luna Lovegood. Luna’s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.” 
“Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,” said Luna in a 
singsong voice. 
She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face 
and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eye-
brows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle. 
The train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It 
was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of 
sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray 
clouds. 
“Guess what I got for my birthday?” said Neville. 
“Another Remembrall?” said Harry, remembering the marblelike 
device Neville’s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his 
abysmal memory. 
“No,” said Neville, “I could do with one, though, I lost the old one 
ages ago. . . . No, look at this. . . .” 
He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into 
his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what ap-
peared to be a small gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered 
with what looked like boils rather than spines. 
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” he said proudly. 
Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the 
rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ. 
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if 
there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show 
it to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. 
I’m going to see if I can breed from it.” 
Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for 
the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted 
little plant. 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 187  
“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked. 
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defen-
sive mechanism — hold Trevor for me. . . .” 
He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his 
schoolbag. Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of 
her upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. 
Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue be-
tween his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with 
the tip of his quill. 
Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-
green jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna 
Lovegood’s magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of 
her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy 
green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the es-
cape of Trevor, received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure. 
Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to 
get the worst out of his eyes. 
“S-sorry,” he gasped. “I haven’t tried that before. . . . Didn’t realize 
it would be quite so . . . Don’t worry, though, Stinksap’s not poiso-
nous,” he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor. 
At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open. 
“Oh . . . hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice. “Um . . . bad time?” 
Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A 
very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway 
smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch 
team. 
“Oh . . . hi,” said Harry blankly. 
“Um . . .” said Cho. “Well . . . just thought I’d say hello . . . ’bye 
then.” 
She closed the door again, rather pink in the face, and departed. 
Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked 
Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 188  
their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to 
be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and 
dripping in Stinksap. 
“Never mind,” said Ginny bracingly. “Look, we can get rid of all 
this easily.” She pulled out her wand. “Scourgify!” 
The Stinksap vanished. 
“Sorry,” said Neville again, in a small voice. 
Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which 
time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville 
had finished their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Choco-
late Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they 
walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pig-
widgeon in his cage. 
“I’m starving,” said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, 
grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the 
seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog’s head, 
and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very ex-
hausting morning. 
“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said 
Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. “Boy 
and girl from each.” 
“And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect?” said Ron, still with his eyes 
closed. 
“Malfoy,” replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed. 
“ ’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his 
mouth and taking another. 
“And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,” said Hermione vicious-
ly. “How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed 
troll . . .” 
“Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked. 
“Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron thickly. 
 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 189  
“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,” said 
Hermione. 
“You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,” said a vague voice. 
Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing un-
blinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler. He swallowed his 
mouthful of Frog. 
“Yeah, I know I did,” he said, looking mildly surprised. 
“She didn’t enjoy it very much,” Luna informed him. “She doesn’t 
think you treated her very well, because you wouldn’t dance with her. 
I don’t think I’d have minded,” she added thoughtfully, “I don’t like 
dancing very much.” 
She retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared at the cover 
with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around 
at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her 
knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his head, 
bemused, then checked his watch. 
“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told 
Harry and Neville, “and we can give out punishments if people are 
misbehaving. I can’t wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something. . . .” 
“You’re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!” said Hermione 
sharply. 
“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” said Ron 
sarcastically. 
“So you’re going to descend to his level?” 
“No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets 
mine.” 
“For heaven’s sake, Ron —” 
“I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates writing,” said Ron 
happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle’s low grunt and, screwing up his 
face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. “I . . . 
must . . . not . . . look . . . like . . . a . . . baboon’s . . . backside. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 190  
Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Love-
good. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up 
and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the 
luggage rack, hissing. She laughed so hard that her magazine slipped 
out of her grasp, slid down her legs, and onto the floor. 
“That was funny!” 
Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring 
at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were 
now laughing at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously 
prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and 
forward, clutching her sides. 
“Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at her. 
“Baboon’s . . . backside!” she choked, holding her ribs. 
Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at 
the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for 
it. Upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front 
was, but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius 
Fudge; Harry only recognized him because of the lime-green bowler 
hat. One of Fudge’s hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the 
other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was captioned: How 
Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts? 
Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine. 
 
CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE: 
How the Tornados Are Taking Control 
SECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED 
SIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim? 
 
“Can I have a look at this?” Harry asked Luna eagerly. 
She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter. 
 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 191  
Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this mo-
ment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed 
Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The 
Quibbler. He found the page and turned excitedly to the article. 
This too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry 
would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn’t been 
captioned. Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his 
wand out. The headline on the article read: 
 
SIRIUS - Black As He’s Painted? 
Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation? 
 
Harry had to read this sentence several times before he was con-
vinced that he had not misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been 
a singing sensation? 
 
For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed 
guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Mug-
gles and one wizard. Black’s audacious escape from 
Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest man-
hunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None 
of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be re-
captured and handed back to the dementors. 
BUT DOES HE? 
Startling new evidence has recently come to light 
that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes 
for which he was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris 
Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may 
not even have been present at the killings. 
“What people don’t realize is that Sirius Black is 
a false name,” says Mrs. Purkiss. “The man people  
 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 192  
believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Board-
man, lead singer of the popular singing group The 
Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being 
struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Nor-
ton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognized 
him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now, 
Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed those 
crimes, because on the day in question he happened 
to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I 
have written to the Minister of Magic and am expect-
ing him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any 
day now.” 
 
Harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps 
it was a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof 
items. He flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge. 
 
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that 
he had any plans to take over the running of the Wiz-
arding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister 
of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always insisted 
that he wants nothing more than to “cooperate 
peacefully” with the guardians of our gold. 
BUT DOES HE? 
Sources close to the Minister have recently dis-
closed that Fudge’s dearest ambition is to seize 
control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will 
not hesitate to use force if need be. 
“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” said a 
Ministry insider. “Cornelius ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge, 
that’s what his friends call him, if you could hear him  
 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 193  
when he thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always 
talking about the goblins he’s had done in; he’s had 
them drowned, he’s had them dropped off buildings, 
he’s had them poisoned, he’s had them cooked in 
pies. . . .” 
 
Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but 
Harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be 
cooked in pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing 
every few pages he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were 
winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal 
broom-tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who 
claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought 
back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes, 
which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler up-
side down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on 
their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy’s ears turn into 
kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, 
the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hob-
goblins was quite sensible. 
“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine. 
“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could an-
swer, “The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.” 
“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy 
quality. “My father’s the editor.” 
“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got 
some interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . .” 
“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward 
she snatched it out of Harry’s hands. Rifling through it to page fifty-
seven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared 
behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time.  
 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 194  
Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the 
sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies 
Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable. 
“What?” he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth. 
“Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” drawled 
Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his 
father’s. “You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which 
means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and 
leave us alone.” 
Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Malfoy’s lip curled. 
“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he 
asked. 
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply. 
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Malfoy, smirking. “Well, just 
watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be dogging your footsteps in case 
you step out of line.” 
“Get out!” said Hermione, standing up. 
Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, 
Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake. Hermione slammed the 
compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who 
knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said 
and been just as unnerved by it. 
“Chuck us another Frog,” said Ron, who had clearly noticed 
nothing. 
Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He ex-
changed another nervous look with Hermione and then stared out of 
the window. 
He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of 
a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous. 
. . . Hermione had been right. . . . Sirius should not have come. What 
if Mr. Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, what if he 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 195  
had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew 
where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy’s use of the word “dogging” 
been a coincidence? 
The weather remained undecided as they traveled farther and far-
ther north. Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the 
sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more. 
When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna 
rolled up The Quibbler, put it carefully away in her bag, and took to 
staring at everyone in the compartment instead. 
Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train win-
dow, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a 
moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy. 
“We’d better change,” said Hermione at last. She and Ron pinned 
their prefect badges carefully to their chests. Harry saw Ron checking 
how it looked in the black window. 
At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket 
up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets 
assembled, ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were supposed to 
supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving 
Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon. 
“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to Harry, reaching out 
for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket. 
“Oh — er — thanks,” said Harry, handing her the cage and hoist-
ing Hedwig’s more securely into his arms. 
They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the 
night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly 
they moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that 
lined the path down to the lake. He stepped down onto the platform 
and looked around, listening for the familiar call of “Firs’ years over 
here . . . firs’ years . . .” 
But it did not come. Instead a quite different voice, a brisk female  
 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 196  
one, was calling, “First years line up over here, please! All first years to 
me!” 
A lantern came swinging toward Harry and by its light he saw the 
prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the 
witch who had taken over Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons 
for a while the previous year. 
“Where’s Hagrid?” he said out loud. 
“I don’t know,” said Ginny, “but we’d better get out of the way, 
we’re blocking the door.” 
“Oh yeah . . .” 
Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the 
platform and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry 
squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be 
here, Harry had been relying on it — seeing Hagrid again had been 
one of the things to which he had been looking forward most. But 
there was no sign of him at all. 
He can’t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through 
a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd. 
He’s just got a cold or something. . . . 
He looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what 
they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but 
neither of them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be 
shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade 
station. 
Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always 
took the students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced 
quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and 
Hermione, then did a double take. 
The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures stand-
ing between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he 
supposed he would have called them horses, though there was some-
thing reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 197  
black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visi-
ble. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and 
staring. Wings sprouted from each wither — vast, black leathery 
wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats. 
Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and 
sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being 
pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of 
moving along by themselves. 
“Where’s Pig?” said Ron’s voice, right behind Harry. 
“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said Harry, turning quickly, ea-
ger to consult Ron about Hagrid. “Where d’you reckon —” 
“— Hagrid is? I dunno,” said Ron, sounding worried. “He’d better 
be okay. . . .” 
A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of 
cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing 
some timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get 
a coach to themselves. Seconds later Hermione emerged panting from 
the crowd. 
“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear 
I’m going to report him, he’s only had his badge three minutes and he’s 
using it to bully people worse than ever. . . . Where’s Crookshanks?” 
“Ginny’s got him,” said Harry. “There she is. . . .” 
Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming 
Crookshanks. 
“Thanks,” said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. “Come on, 
let’s get a carriage together before they all fill up. . . .” 
“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said, but Hermione was already head-
ing off toward the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind 
with Ron. 
“What are those things, d’you reckon?” he asked Ron, nodding at 
the horrible horses as the other students surged past them. 
“What things?” 
CHAPTER  TEN 
 198  
“Those horse —” 
Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon’s cage in her arms; the tiny owl 
was twittering excitedly as usual. 
“Here you are,” she said. “He’s a sweet little owl, isn’t he?” 
“Er . . . yeah . . . He’s all right,” said Ron gruffly. “Well, come on 
then, let’s get in. . . . what were you saying, Harry?” 
“I was saying, what are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, 
and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were 
already sitting. 
“What horse things?” 
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently; 
they were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was 
watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a 
perplexed look. 
“What are you talking about?” 
“I’m talking about — look!” 
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was 
face-to-face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a sec-
ond, then looked back at Harry. 
“What am I supposed to be looking at?” 
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s 
right there in front —” 
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred 
to Harry. 
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?” 
“See what?” 
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?” 
Ron looked seriously alarmed now. 
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?” 
“I . . . yeah . . .” 
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him, 
gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows 
LUNA  LOVEGOOD 
 199  
behind them, vapor rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet 
unless Ron was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was — 
Ron could not see it at all. 
“Shall we get in, then?” said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as 
though worried about him. 
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, go on . . .” 
“It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron van-
ished into the coach’s dark interior. “You’re not going mad or anything. 
I can see them too.” 
“Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see 
the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide, silvery eyes. 
“Oh yes,” said Luna, “I’ve been able to see them ever since my first 
day here. They’ve always pulled the carriages. Don’t worry. You’re just 
as sane as I am.” 
Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage 
after Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.

arry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were 
having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he 
said nothing about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and 
slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help 
watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window. 
“Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?” asked Ginny. 
“What’s she doing back here? Hagrid can’t have left, can he?” 
“I’ll be quite glad if he has,” said Luna. “He isn’t a very good 
teacher, is he?” 
“Yes, he is!” said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily. 
Harry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said, 
“Erm . . . yes . . . he’s very good.” 
“Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna, 
unfazed. 
“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the 
wheels below them creaked into motion. 
Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary,

she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly inter-
esting television program. 
Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road. 
When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged 
boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned 
forward to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid’s 
cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete 
darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering 
mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window 
blazing fiery bright above them. 
The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the 
oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned 
again to look for lit windows down by the forest, but there was defi-
nitely no sign of life within Hagrid’s cabin. Unwillingly, because he 
had half hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead 
upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night 
air, their blank white eyes gleaming. 
Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that 
Ron could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something 
much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts 
strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed, 
the beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could Harry 
suddenly see them, and why could Ron not? 
“Are you coming or what?” said Ron beside him. 
“Oh . . . yeah,” said Harry quickly, and they joined the crowd hur-
rying up the stone steps into the castle. 
The entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with foot-
steps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double 
doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term 
feast. 
The four long House tables in the Great Hall were filling up under  
 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 202  
the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could 
glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all 
along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted 
about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one an-
other, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from 
other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and robes. Again 
Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he 
passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither no-
ticed nor cared. 
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment 
they reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth 
years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville 
found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly 
Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and 
Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly 
friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking 
about him a split second before. He had more important things to 
worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to the 
staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall. 
“He’s not there.” 
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was 
no real need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup. 
“He can’t have left,” said Ron, sounding slightly anxious. 
“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly. 
“You don’t think he’s . . . hurt, or anything, do you?” said Hermione 
uneasily. 
“No,” said Harry at once. 
“But where is he, then?” 
There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, 
Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, “Maybe he’s not back yet. You 
know — from his mission — the thing he was doing over the sum-
mer for Dumbledore.”

 203  
“Yeah . . . yeah, that’ll be it,” said Ron, sounding reassured, but 
Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though 
hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid’s absence. 
“Who’s that?” she said sharply, pointing toward the middle of the 
staff table. 
Harry’s eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumble-
dore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the center of the long 
staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and 
a matching hat. Dumbledore’s head was inclined toward the woman 
sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry 
thought, like somebody’s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, 
mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band 
that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes. Then 
she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, 
with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of promi-
nent, pouchy eyes. 
“It’s that Umbridge woman!” 
“Who?” said Hermione. 
“She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!” 
“Nice cardigan,” said Ron, smirking. 
“She works for Fudge?” Hermione repeated, frowning. “What on 
earth’s she doing here, then?” 
“Dunno . . .” 
Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed. 
“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not . . .” 
Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not 
ask; his attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank 
who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way 
along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Ha-
grid’s. That meant that the first years must have crossed the lake and 
reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors 
from the entrance hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first years 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 204  
entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on 
which sat an ancient wizard’s hat, heavily patched and darned with a 
wide rip near the frayed brim. 
The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first years lined 
up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Pro-
fessor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then 
stood back. 
The first years’ faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy 
right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling. 
Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood 
there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which 
House he belonged. 
The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the 
hat’s brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into 
song: 
 
In times of old when I was new 
And Hogwarts barely started 
The founders of our noble school 
Thought never to be parted: 
United by a common goal, 
They had the selfsame yearning, 
To make the world’s best magic school 
And pass along their learning. 
“Together we will build and teach!” 
The four good friends decided 
And never did they dream that they 
Might someday be divided, 
For were there such friends anywhere 
As Slytherin and Gryffndor? 
Unless it was the second pair 
Of Huffepuff and Ravenclaw? 
THE  SORTING  HAT’S 
NEW  SONG 
 205  
So how could it have gone so wrong? 
How could such friendships fail? 
Why, I was there and so can tell 
The whole sad, sorry tale. 
Said Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those 
Whose ancestry is purest.” 
Said Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose 
Intelligence is surest.” 
Said Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those 
With brave deeds to their name,” 
Said Hufflepujf, “I’ll teach the lot, 
And treat them just the same.” 
These differences caused little strife 
When first they came to light, 
For each of the four founders had 
A House in which they might 
Take only those they wanted, so, 
For instance, Slytherin 
Took only pure-blood wizards 
Of great cunning, just like him, 
And only those of sharpest mind 
Were taught by Ravenclaw 
While the bravest and the boldest 
Went to daring Gryffindor. 
Good Hufflepujf she took the rest, 
And taught them all she knew, 
Thus the Houses and their founders 
Retained friendships firm and true. 
So Hogwarts worked in harmony 
For several happy years, 
But then discord crept among us 
Feeding on our faults and fears. 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 206  
The Houses that, like pillars four, 
Had once held up our school, 
Now turned upon each other and, 
Divided, sought to rule. 
And for a while it seemed the school 
Must meet an early end, 
What with dueling and with fighting 
And the clash of friend on friend 
And at last there came a morning 
When old Slytherin departed 
And though the fighting then died out 
He left us quite downhearted. 
And never since the founders four 
Were whittled down to three 
Have the Houses been united 
As they once were meant to be. 
And now the Sorting Hat is here 
And you all know the score: 
I sort you into Houses 
Because that is what I’m for, 
But this year I’ll go further, 
Listen closely to my song: 
Though condemned I am to split you 
Still I worry that it’s wrong, 
Though I must fulfill my duty 
And must quarter every year 
Still I wonder whether sorting 
May not bring the end I fear. 
Oh, know the perils, read the signs, 
The warning history shows, 
For our Hogwarts is in danger 
From external, deadly foes 
THE  SORTING  HAT’S 
NEW  SONG 
 207  
And we must unite inside her 
Or we’ll crumble from within. 
I have told you, I have warned you. . . . 
Let the Sorting now begin. 
 
The hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though 
it was punctured, for the first time in Harry’s memory, with mutter-
ing and whispers. All across the Great Hall students were exchanging 
remarks with their neighbors and Harry, clapping along with every-
one else, knew exactly what they were talking about. 
“Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it?” said Ron, his eyebrows 
raised. 
“Too right it has,” said Harry. 
The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different 
qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts Houses and its own 
role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give 
the school advice before. 
“I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before?” said Hermione, 
sounding slightly anxious. 
“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning 
across Neville toward her (Neville winced, it was very uncomfortable 
to have a ghost lean through you). “The hat feels itself honor-bound 
to give the school due warning whenever it feels —” 
But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of 
first years’ names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look 
that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his 
lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt 
end. With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables, Pro-
fessor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment 
and called out, 
“Abercrombie, Euan.” 
The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 208  
forward and put the hat on his head; it was only prevented from 
falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat 
considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again 
and shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” 
Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan 
Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though 
he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be 
looked at again. 
Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between 
the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, Harry could hear Ron’s 
stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into Huf-
flepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and 
marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet. 
Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before 
them all, whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster. 
Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish 
horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, 
was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song. 
But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster ris-
ing to greet them all before the start-of-term feast. 
“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms 
stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, “welcome! To our old 
hands — welcome back! There is a time for speech making, but this is 
not it. Tuck in!” 
There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dum-
bledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as 
to keep it out of the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of 
nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies 
and dishes of vegetables, bread, sauces, and flagons of pumpkin juice. 
“Excellent,” said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he 
seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them onto his plate, 
watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick. 
THE  SORTING  HAT’S 
NEW  SONG 
 209  
“What were you saying before the Sorting?” Hermione asked the 
ghost. “About the hat giving warnings?” 
“Oh yes,” said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away 
from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent 
enthusiasm. “Yes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before, 
always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school. 
And always, of course, its advice is the same: Stand together, be strong 
from within.” 
“Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?” said Ron. 
His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement 
for him to make any noise at all. 
“I beg your pardon?” said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while 
Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said, 
“How can it know if the school’s in danger if it’s a hat?” 
“I have no idea,” said Nearly Headless Nick. “Of course, it lives in 
Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.” 
“And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said Harry, looking 
over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court. 
“Fat chance.” 
“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude,” said Nick reprovingly. 
“Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to 
separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the compet-
itiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of 
seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.” 
“Only because you’re terrified of him,” said Ron. 
Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted. 
“Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never 
been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my 
veins —” 
“What blood?” asked Ron. “Surely you haven’t still got — ?” 
“It’s a figure of speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed 
his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck. “I 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 210  
assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like, 
even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am 
quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!” 
“Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you!” said Hermione, throwing 
a furious look at Ron. 
Unfortunately, Ron’s mouth was packed to exploding point again 
and all he could manage was “node iddum eentup sechew,” which 
Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology. Rising 
into the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from 
them to the other end of the table, coming to rest between the 
Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis. 
“Well done, Ron,” snapped Hermione. 
“What?” said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow 
his food. “I’m not allowed to ask a simple question?” 
“Oh forget it,” said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent 
the rest of the meal in huffy silence. 
Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile 
them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily 
through his steak-and-kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favorite 
treacle tart. 
When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the 
hall was starting to creep upward again, Dumbledore got to his feet 
once more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the head-
master. Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed 
was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft. . . . 
“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg 
a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,” 
said Dumbledore. “First years ought to know that the forest in the 
grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students 
ought to know by now too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged 
smirks.) 
 
THE  SORTING  HAT’S

“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the 
four hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is 
not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other 
things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened 
to Mr. Filch’s office door. 
“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased 
to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of 
Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Profes-
sor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” 
There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause dur-
ing which Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged slightly panicked 
looks; Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would 
be teaching. 
Dumbledore continued, “Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams 
will take place on the —” 
He broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor Umbridge. As she 
was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when 
nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then 
Professor Umbridge said, “Hem, hem,” and it became clear that she 
had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech. 
Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat 
back down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as 
though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk. Other 
members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor 
Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair, and Profes-
sor McGonagall’s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it. No 
new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the 
students were smirking; this woman obviously did not know how 
things were done at Hogwarts. 
“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor Umbridge simpered, “for 
those kind words of welcome.” 
 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 212  
Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again, 
Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to him-
self; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her 
stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan. She gave another little throat-
clearing cough (“Hem, hem”) and continued: “Well, it is lovely to be 
back at Hogwarts, I must say!” She smiled, revealing very pointed 
teeth. “And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!” 
Harry glanced around. None of the faces he could see looked 
happy; on the contrary, they all looked rather taken aback at being 
addressed as though they were five years old. 
“I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and 
I’m sure we’ll be very good friends!” 
Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely con-
cealing grins. 
“I’ll be her friend as long as I don’t have to borrow that cardigan,” 
Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent 
giggles. 
Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again (“Hem, hem”), but 
when she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her 
voice. She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a 
dull learned-by-heart sound to them. 
“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of 
young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts 
with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and 
honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the Wiz-
arding community must be passed down through the generations lest 
we lose them forever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge 
amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished 
by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.” 
Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her 
fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back. Professor McGona-
gall’s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively 
THE  SORTING  HAT’S 
NEW  SONG 
 213  
hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance 
with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little “Hem, hem” and 
went on with her speech. 
“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought 
something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, 
and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation 
and decay. There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discour-
aged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A 
balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, 
between tradition and innovation . . .” 
Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slip-
ping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when 
Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads 
together, whispering and giggling. Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho 
Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along 
from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Mean-
while at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still 
staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was 
sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the 
new prefect’s badge gleaming on his chest. 
Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her 
audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have 
broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her 
speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and 
Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, 
though judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste. 
“. . . because some changes will be for the better, while others will 
come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment. 
Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas 
others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move 
forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and account-
ability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 214  
what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices 
that ought to be prohibited.” 
She sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, 
though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands to-
gether only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in, 
but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not hav-
ing listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start 
applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again. 
“Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illumi-
nating,” he said, bowing to her. “Now — as I was saying, Quidditch 
tryouts will be held . . .” 
“Yes, it certainly was illuminating,” said Hermione in a low voice. 
“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” Ron said quietly, turning a 
glazed face upon Hermione. “That was about the dullest speech I’ve 
ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.” 
“I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione. “It explained 
a lot.” 
“Did it?” said Harry in surprise. “Sounded like a load of waffle to me.” 
“There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,” said Her-
mione grimly. 
“Was there?” said Ron blankly. 
“How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged’? How 
about ‘pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited’?” 
“Well, what does that mean?” said Ron impatiently. 
“I’ll tell you what it means,” said Hermione ominously. “It means 
the Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.” 
There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumb-
ledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was 
standing up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking 
flustered. 
“Ron, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go!” 
 
THE  SORTING  HAT’S 
NEW  SONG 
 215  
“Oh yeah,” said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. “Hey — hey 
you lot! Midgets!” 
“Ron!” 
“Well, they are, they’re titchy. . . .” 
“I know, but you can’t call them midgets. . . . First years!” Hermione 
called commandingly along the table. “This way, please!” 
A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the 
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead 
the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had 
not appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at 
them. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified, 
nudged Euan, and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie 
looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt 
the grin slide off his face like Stinksap. 
“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way 
out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more 
whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed 
ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall, then 
he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short-
cuts, and had soon left most of the crowds behind. 
He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily, as he 
walked through much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone 
was staring at him: He had emerged from the Triwizard maze two 
months ago clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming 
to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been 
time last term to explain himself before everyone went home, even if 
he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the ter-
rible events in that graveyard. 
He had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common 
room and had come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady 
before he realized that he did not know the new password. 
 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 216  
“Er . . .” he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed 
the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him. 
“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily. 
“Harry, I know it!” someone panted from behind him, and he 
turned to see Neville jogging toward him. “Guess what it is? I’m actu-
ally going to be able to remember it for once —” He waved the 
stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train. “Mimbulus 
mimbletonia!” 
“Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open toward 
them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through 
which Harry and Neville now climbed. 
The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cozy 
circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety 
old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people 
were warming their hands before going up to their dormitories; on the 
other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning some-
thing up on the notice board. Harry waved good night to them and 
headed straight for the door to the boys’ dormitories; he was not in 
much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him. 
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory 
first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds 
with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry 
pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw 
him. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then 
whether he was being paranoid. 
“Hi,” he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it. 
“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in 
the West Ham colors. “Good holiday?” 
“Not bad,” muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would 
have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. “You?” 
“Yeah, it was okay,” chuckled Dean. “Better than Seamus’s anyway, 
he was just telling me.” 
THE  SORTING  HAT’S

 217  
“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his 
Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet. 
Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal 
of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team 
was quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, 
“Me mam didn’t want me to come back.” 
“What?” said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes. 
“She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts.” 
Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas 
out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry. 
“But — why?” said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus’s 
mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she 
should have come over so Dursley-ish. 
Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pajamas. 
“Well,” he said in a measured voice, “I suppose . . . because of you.” 
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. His heart was beating 
rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him. 
“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she . . . er 
. . . well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too . . .” 
“She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry. “She thinks I’m a liar 
and Dumbledore’s an old fool?” 
Seamus looked up at him. “Yeah, something like that.” 
Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down onto his bedside 
table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk, and 
pulled on his pajamas. He was sick of it; sick of being the person who 
was stared at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any 
of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these 
things had happened to . . . Mrs. Finnigan had no idea, the stupid 
woman, he thought savagely. 
He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, 
but before he could do so, Seamus said, “Look . . . what did happen 
that night when . . . you know, when . . . with Cedric Diggory and all?” 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN

Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who 
had been bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went 
oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard. 
“What are you asking me for?” Harry retorted. “Just read the Daily 
Prophet like your mother, why don’t you? That’ll tell you all you need 
to know.” 
“Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped Seamus. 
“I’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,” said Harry. 
“Don’t talk to me like that!” 
“I’ll talk to you how I want,” said Harry, his temper rising so fast he 
snatched his wand back from his bedside table. “If you’ve got a prob-
lem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can 
be moved, stop your mummy worrying —” 
“Leave my mother out of this, Potter!” 
“What’s going on?” 
Ron had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes traveled from 
Harry, who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Sea-
mus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his fists raised. 
“He’s having a go at my mother!” Seamus yelled. 
“What?” said Ron. “Harry wouldn’t do that — we met your mother, 
we liked her. . . .” 
“That’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily 
Prophet writes about me!” said Harry at the top of his voice. 
“Oh,” said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face. 
“Oh . . . right.” 
“You know what?” said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous 
look. “He’s right, I don’t want to share a dormitory with him any-
more, he’s a madman.” 
“That’s out of order, Seamus,” said Ron, whose ears were starting to 
glow red, always a danger sign. 
“Out of order, am I?” shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron

was turning paler. “You believe all the rubbish he’s come out with 
about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he’s telling the truth?” 
“Yeah, I do!” said Ron angrily. 
“Then you’re mad too,” said Seamus in disgust. 
“Yeah? Well unfortunately for you, pal, I’m also a prefect!” said 
Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger. “So unless you want 
detention, watch your mouth!” 
Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a 
reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but 
with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and 
pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped 
from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Sea-
mus, then looked at Dean and Neville. 
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said 
aggressively. 
“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They 
don’t know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not 
stupid enough to tell them.” 
“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything out of anyone!” 
Seamus snapped at him. “Anyway, your parents don’t get the Daily 
Prophet, they don’t know our headmaster’s been sacked from the Wiz-
engamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he’s 
losing his marbles —” 
“My gran says that’s rubbish,” piped up Neville. “She says it’s the 
Daily Prophet that’s going downhill, not Dumbledore. She’s canceled 
our subscription. We believe Harry,” he said simply. He climbed into 
bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them 
at Seamus. “My gran’s always said You-Know-Who would come back 
one day. She says if Dumbledore says he’s back, he’s back.” 
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Neville. Nobody else said 
anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and  
 
CHAPTER  ELEVEN 
 220  
vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over, and fell silent. 
Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing 
fondly at his moonlit cactus. 
Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next 
bed, putting his things away. He felt shaken by the argument with 
Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more peo-
ple were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged? 
Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizen-
gamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown 
him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had 
stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two 
of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed 
Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then 
to the wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was 
a liar had to think that Dumbledore was too or else that Dumbledore 
had been hoodwinked. . . . 
They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron 
got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he 
wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s he would have to endure 
before that time came.

eamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory 
before Harry had even put on his socks. 
“Does he think he’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me 
too long?” asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamus’s robes whipped 
out of sight. 
“Don’t worry about it, Harry,” Dean muttered, hoisting his school-
bag onto his shoulder. “He’s just . . .” But apparently he was unable to 
say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause fol-
lowed him out of the room. 
Neville and Ron both gave Harry it’s-his-problem-not-yours looks, 
but Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this was he 
going to have to take? 
“What’s the matter?” asked Hermione five minutes later, catching 
up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all 
headed toward breakfast. “You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s 
sake.” 
She was staring at the common room notice board, where a large 
new sign had been put up.

 “They are the limit,” said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, 
which Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of 
the first Hogsmeade weekend in October. “We’ll have to talk to them, 
Ron.” 
Ron looked positively alarmed. 
“Why?” 
“Because we’re prefects!” said Hermione, as they climbed out 
through the portrait hole. “It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!” 
Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that 
the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they 
liked was not one that he found inviting. 
“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as they walked 
down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, 
all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation. 
“You look really angry about something.” 
“Seamus reckons Harry’s lying about You-Know-Who,” said Ron 
succinctly, when Harry did not respond. 
Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, 
sighed. 
“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily. 
“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I’m a 
lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?” Harry said loudly. 
“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 223  
shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped 
jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t 
noticed, we’re on your side.” 
There was a short pause. 
“Sorry,” said Harry in a low voice. 
“That’s quite all right,” said Hermione with dignity. Then she 
shook her head. “Don’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the 
end-of-term feast last year?” 
Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and Hermione sighed 
again. 
“About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and 
enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong 
bond of friendship and trust —’” 
“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, looking at her 
in admiration. 
“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of asperity. 
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what —” 
“The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing 
is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s 
only been back two months, and we’ve started fighting among our-
selves. And the Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together, 
be united —” 
“And Harry said it last night,” retorted Ron, “if that means we’re 
supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.” 
“Well, I think it’s a pity we’re not trying for a bit of inter-House 
unity,” said Hermione crossly. 
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-
year Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of 
Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he 
might attack stragglers. 
“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like 
that,” said Harry sarcastically. 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 224  
They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, looking in-
stinctively at the staff table as they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank 
was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid 
was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceil-
ing above them echoed Harry’s mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud 
gray. 
“Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank 
woman’s staying,” he said, as they made their way across to the 
Gryffindor table. 
“Maybe . . .” said Hermione thoughtfully. 
“What?” said both Harry and Ron together. 
“Well . . . maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to Hagrid not 
being here.” 
“What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said Ron, half laughing. 
“How could we not notice?” 
Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided 
hair had marched up to Harry. 
“Hi, Angelina.” 
“Hi,” she said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an 
answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.” 
“Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina’s 
pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been, 
which could only be an improvement. 
“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left. Tryouts are on 
Friday at five o’clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then 
we can see how the new person’ll fit in.” 
“Okay,” said Harry, and she smiled at him and departed. 
“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely, sitting down 
beside Ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her. “I suppose that will 
make quite a difference to the team?” 
“I s’pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He was a good 
Keeper. . . .” 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 225  
“Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said Ron. 
With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in 
through the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bring-
ing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters 
with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was 
nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only corre-
spondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new 
to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however, 
had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large 
damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak. 
“What are you still getting that for?” said Harry irritably, thinking 
of Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the 
owl’s leg and it took off again. “I’m not bothering . . . load of 
rubbish.” 
“It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said Hermione 
darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, 
not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating. 
“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it 
down by her plate. “Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.” 
Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing 
out schedules. 
“Look at today!” groaned Ron. “History of Magic, double Potions, 
Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, 
Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred 
and George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted. . . .” 
“Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with George and 
squeezing onto the bench beside Harry. “Hogwarts prefects surely 
don’t wish to skive off lessons?” 
“Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his 
schedule under Fred’s nose. “That’s the worst Monday I’ve ever seen.” 
“Fair point, little bro,” said Fred, scanning the column. “You can 
have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.” 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 226  
“Why’s it cheap?” said Ron suspiciously. 
“Because you’ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven’t got an 
antidote yet,” said George, helping himself to a kipper. 
“Cheers,” said Ron moodily, pocketing his schedule, “but I think 
I’ll take the lessons.” 
“And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said Hermione, eyeing 
Fred and George beadily, “you can’t advertise for testers on the 
Gryffindor notice board.” 
“Says who?” said George, looking astonished. 
“Says me,” said Hermione. “And Ron.” 
“Leave me out of it,” said Ron hastily. 
Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered. 
“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,” said 
Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. “You’re starting your fifth year, 
you’ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.” 
“And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snack-
box?” asked Hermione. 
“Fifth year’s O.W.L. year,” said George. 
“So?” 
“So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? They’ll be keep-
ing your noses so hard to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said 
Fred with satisfaction. 
“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said 
George happily. “Tears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept com-
ing over faint. . . .” 
“Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d’you remember?” said Fred 
reminiscently. 
“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas,” said 
George. 
“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning. “I’d forgotten. . . . Hard to keep 
track sometimes, isn’t it?” 
“Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,” said George. “If you 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 227  
care about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spir-
its up somehow.” 
“Yeah . . . you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?” said Ron. 
“Yep,” said Fred unconcernedly. “But we feel our futures lie outside 
the world of academic achievement.” 
“We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming 
back for our seventh year,” said George brightly, “now that we’ve 
got —” 
He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had 
been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them. 
“— now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,” George said hastily. “I mean, 
do we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we didn’t think Mum could take us 
leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s 
biggest prat.” 
“We’re not going to waste our last year here, though,” said Fred, 
looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. “We’re going to use it 
to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hog-
warts student requires from his joke shop, carefully evaluate the results 
of our research, and then produce the products to fit the demand.” 
“But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?” 
asked Hermione skeptically. “You’re going to need all the ingredients 
and materials — and premises too, I suppose. . . .” 
Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately 
dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say 
overhead, “Ask us no questions and we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione. 
C’mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Ex-
tendable Ears before Herbology.” 
Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walk-
ing away, each carrying a stack of toast. 
“What did that mean?” said Hermione, looking from Harry to 
Ron. “ ‘Ask us no questions . . .’ Does that mean they’ve already got 
some gold to start a joke shop?” 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 228  
“You know, I’ve been wondering about that,” said Ron, his brow 
furrowed. “They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and 
I couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons. . . .” 
Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these 
dangerous waters. 
“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough? Because 
of the exams?” 
“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really 
important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get 
career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what 
N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.” 
“D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” Harry asked 
the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off 
toward their History of Magic classroom. 
“Not really,” said Ron slowly. “Except . . . well . . .” 
He looked slightly sheepish. 
“What?” Harry urged him. 
“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror,” said Ron in an offhand voice. 
“Yeah, it would,” said Harry fervently. 
“But they’re, like, the elite,” said Ron. “You’ve got to be really good. 
What about you, Hermione?” 
“I don’t know,” said Hermione. “I think I’d really like to do some-
thing worthwhile.” 
“An Auror’s worthwhile!” said Harry. 
“Yes, it is, but it’s not the only worthwhile thing,” said Hermione 
thoughtfully. “I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further . . .” 
Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other. 
History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject 
ever devised by Wizard-kind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had 
a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe 
drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. He never varied 
the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 229  
they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron 
had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying 
Hermione’s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the so-
porific power of Binns’s voice. 
Today they suffered through three quarters of an hour’s droning on 
the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten 
minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this 
subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain 
disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing 
hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione 
shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye. 
“How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom 
for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused 
to lend you my notes this year?” 
“We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on your con-
science, Hermione . . .” 
“Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped. “You don’t even try to listen 
to him, do you?” 
“We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven’t got your brains or your 
memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are — 
is it nice to rub it in?” 
“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked 
slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard. 
A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in hud-
dles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, 
turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air 
and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson 
of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be 
something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a 
two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward 
them. 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 230  
“Hello, Harry!” 
It was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on her own again. 
This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang 
of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by 
herself to ask her to the Yule Ball. 
“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you’re not covered  
in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along 
the same lines. 
“You got that stuff off, then?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their 
last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. “So did you . . . er 
. . . have a good summer?” 
The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been 
Cho’s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her 
holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry’s. . . . Something 
seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, “Oh, it was all right, you 
know. . . .” 
“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron demanded suddenly, pointing at 
the front of Cho’s robes, to which a sky-blue badge emblazoned with 
a double gold T was pinned. “You don’t support them, do you?” 
“Yeah, I do,” said Cho. 
“Have you always supported them, or just since they started win-
ning the league?” said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily 
accusatory tone of voice. 
“I’ve supported them since I was six,” said Cho coolly. “Anyway . . . 
see you, Harry.” 
She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across 
the courtyard before rounding on Ron. 
“You are so tactless!” 
“What? I only asked her if —” 
“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?” 
 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 231  
“So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping —” 
“What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team 
for?” 
“Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only —” 
“Who cares if she supports the Tornados?” 
“Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only 
bought them last season —” 
“But what does it matter?” 
“It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the 
bandwagon —” 
“That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione 
were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the 
way down to Snape’s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to re-
flect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two 
minutes’ conversation with Cho that he could look back on without 
wanting to leave the country. 
And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside 
Snape’s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn’t 
she? She had been Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry 
for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet 
she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she 
thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for 
Cedric’s death. . . . Yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to 
him, and that made the second time in two days . . . and at this 
thought, Harry’s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape’s dun-
geon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble 
that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom be-
hind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the 
back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them. 
“Settle down,” said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him. 
There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class  
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 232  
had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped. 
Snape’s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class’s silence. 
“Before we begin today’s lesson,” said Snape, sweeping over to his 
desk and staring around at them all, “I think it appropriate to remind 
you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, dur-
ing which you will prove how much you have learned about the 
composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of 
this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in 
your O.W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure.” 
His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped. 
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with 
me,” Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. 
Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying 
good-bye.” 
His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feel-
ing a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions 
after fifth year. 
“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of 
farewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt 
N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon 
maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my 
O.W.L. students. 
“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary 
Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and 
soothe agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the 
ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irre-
versible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are 
doing.” On Harry’s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expres-
sion one of the utmost attentiveness. “The ingredients and method” 
— Snape flicked his wand — “are on the blackboard” — (they ap-
peared there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his  
 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 233  
wand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of the said cup-
board sprang open) — “you have an hour and a half. . . . Start.” 
Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could 
hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients 
had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quan-
tities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, 
firstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise directions; the heat of 
the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the 
right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient 
was added. 
“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called 
Snape, with ten minutes left to go. 
Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the 
dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray 
steam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prod-
ding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as 
they had gone out. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a 
shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked 
down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he 
could find nothing to criticize. At Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape 
stopped, looking down at Harry with a horrible smirk on his face. 
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?” 
The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they 
loved hearing Snape taunt Harry. 
“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely. 
“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?” 
Draco Malfoy laughed. 
“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his 
wand. 
“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.” 
Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the  
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 234  
instructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the 
dungeon. 
“ ‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, al-
low to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of 
hellebore.’ ” 
His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had pro-
ceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his 
potion to simmer for seven minutes. 
“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?” 
“No,” said Harry very quietly. 
“I beg your pardon?” 
“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the hellebore. . . .” 
“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly 
worthless. Evanesco.” 
The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing fool-
ishly beside an empty cauldron. 
“Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one 
flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, 
and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework: 
twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its 
uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.” 
While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away 
his things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron’s, which 
was now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had 
achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was 
now having to gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, Harry, who 
would be receiving zero marks for the day’s work. He stuffed his wand 
back into his bag and slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone 
else march up to Snape’s desk with filled and corked flagons. When at 
long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had al-
ready started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in

the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an even murkier gray during 
the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows. 
“That was really unfair,” said Hermione consolingly, sitting down 
next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd’s pie. “Your potion 
wasn’t nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole 
thing shattered and set his robes on fire.” 
“Yeah, well,” said Harry, glowering at his plate, “since when has 
Snape ever been fair to me?” 
Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape 
and Harry’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment 
Harry had set foot in Hogwarts. 
“I did think he might be a bit better this year,” said Hermione in a 
disappointed voice. “I mean . . . you know . . .” She looked carefully 
around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and 
nobody was passing the table. “. . . Now he’s in the Order and 
everything.” 
“Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,” said Ron sagely. 
“Anyway, I’ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting 
Snape, where’s the evidence he ever really stopped working for You-
Know-Who?” 
“I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he 
doesn’t share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione. 
“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened 
his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking an-
gry and offended. “Can’t you give it a rest?” he said. “You’re always 
having a go at each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning his 
shepherd’s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left 
them sitting there. 
He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the 
many students hurrying toward lunch. The anger that had just flared 
so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and  
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 236  
Hermione’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction. 
Serve them right, he thought. Why can’t they give it a rest? . . . Bickering 
all the time . . . It’s enough to drive anyone up the wall. . . . 
He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; 
Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who 
ignored him. 
“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cado-
gan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked 
on, and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into 
a neighboring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and 
angry-looking wolfhound. 
Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the 
trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently he was the first 
to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawney’s classroom 
when the bell rang. 
Divination was Harry’s least favorite class after Potions, which was 
due mainly to Professor Trelawney’s habit of predicting his premature 
death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and 
glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some 
kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was 
busy putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the 
spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry en-
tered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by 
scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not 
to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class ar-
rived over the next five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, 
looked around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or 
as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables, 
chairs, and overstuffed poufs. 
“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down 
beside Harry. 
“Good,” grunted Harry. 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 237  
“But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped tak-
ing out your temper on us,” said Ron. 
“I’m not —” 
“I’m just passing on the message,” said Ron, talking over him. “But 
I reckon she’s right. It’s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat 
you.” 
“I never said it —” 
“Good day,” said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy 
voice, and Harry broke off, feeling both annoyed and slightly 
ashamed of himself again. “And welcome back to Divination. I have, 
of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holi-
days, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts 
safely — as, of course, I knew you would. 
“You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, 
by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of di-
vining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your 
O.W.L. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are 
of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of div-
ination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very 
little. However, the headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so . . .” 
Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that 
Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters 
as examinations. 
“Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say 
on the matter of dream interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use 
The Dream Oracle to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. Carry 
on. 
The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a 
double period. By the time they had all finished reading the introduc-
tion of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpre-
tation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with 
Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 238  
a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grand-
mother’s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly. 
“I never remember my dreams,” said Ron. “You say one.” 
“You must remember one of them,” said Harry impatiently. 
He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew per-
fectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did 
not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to 
tell him that. . . . 
“Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,” 
said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. “What d’you 
reckon that means?” 
“Probably that you’re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or 
something,” said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle with-
out interest. 
It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and 
Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task 
of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell 
went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling 
loudly. 
“D’you realize how much homework we’ve got already? Binns set 
us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on 
the use of moonstones, and now we’ve got a month’s dream diary from 
Trelawney! Fred and George weren’t wrong about O.W.L. year, were 
they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any. . . .” 
When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom 
they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher’s desk, 
wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black vel-
vet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a 
large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad. 
The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge 
was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a 
disciplinarian she was likely to be. 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 239  
“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the whole class had 
sat down. 
A few people mumbled “Good afternoon,” in reply. 
“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge. “That won’t do, now, will it? I 
should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Um-
bridge.’ One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!” 
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted back at her. 
“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly. “That wasn’t too 
difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.” 
Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order “wands away” 
had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. 
Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink, 
and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted 
her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the 
blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once: 
 
Defense Against the Dark Arts 
A Return to Basic Principles. 
 
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted 
and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face 
the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. “The constant 
changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed 
any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in 
your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your 
O.W.L. year. 
“You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now 
to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-
centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. 
Copy down the following, please.” 
She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and 
was replaced by: 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 240  
Course aims: 
1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic. 
2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic 
can legally be used. 
3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for 
practical use. 
 
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratch-
ing quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor 
Umbridge’s three course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of 
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” 
There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class. 
“I think we’ll try that again,” said Professor Umbridge. “When I 
ask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Um-
bridge,’ or ‘No, Professor Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of 
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?” 
“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” rang through the room. 
“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to 
page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be 
no need to talk.” 
Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the 
chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy 
toad’s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical  
Theory and started to read. 
It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. 
He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the 
same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few 
words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-
mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the 
same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to 
shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy 
 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 241  
 of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Um-
bridge with her hand in the air. 
Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when 
instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book 
that came under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she 
merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to 
answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who 
was looking just as resolutely in another direction. 
After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the 
only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed 
to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to 
watch Hermione’s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge’s eye 
than to struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.” 
When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather 
than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she 
could ignore the situation no longer. 
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she 
asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her. 
“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione. 
“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor Umbridge, showing 
her small, pointed teeth. “If you have other queries we can deal with 
them at the end of class.” 
“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione. 
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows. 
“And your name is — ?” 
“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione. 
“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if 
you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice 
of determined sweetness. 
“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written 
up there about using defensive spells.” 
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 242  
There was a short silence in which many members of the class 
turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on 
the blackboard. 
“Using defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little 
laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom 
that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You 
surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?” 
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly. 
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, 
Mr. — ?” 
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air. 
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on 
him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Pro-
fessor Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before 
she addressed Hermione. 
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?” 
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against 
the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?” 
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” 
asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice. 
“No, but —” 
“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the 
‘whole point’ of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than 
you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning 
about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —” 
“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked 
it won’t be in a —” 
“Hand, Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge. 
Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly 
turned away from him again, but now several other people had their 
hands up too. 
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean. 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 243  
“Dean Thomas.” 
“Well, Mr. Thomas?” 
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be 
attacked, it won’t be risk-free —” 
“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating 
fashion at Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?” 
“No, but —” 
Professor Umbridge talked over him. 
“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this 
school,” she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, 
“but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this 
class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” she gave a nasty 
little laugh, “extremely dangerous half-breeds.” 
“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean Thomas angrily, 
“he was the best we ever —” 
“Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been introduced 
to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and 
potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are 
likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —” 
“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just —” 
“Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!” 
Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from 
her. 
“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed il-
legal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —” 
“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas 
hotly. “Mind you, we still learned loads —” 
“Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!” trilled Professor Umbridge. 
“Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will 
be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, 
after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?” she added, 
staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up. 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 244  
“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against 
the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actu-
ally do the countercurses and things?” 
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no 
reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under care-
fully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge 
dismissively. 
“Without ever practicing them before?” said Parvati incredulously. 
“Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be 
during our exam?” 
“I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough —” 
“And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry 
loudly, his fist in the air again. 
Professor Umbridge looked up. 
“This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,” she said softly. 
“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out 
there?” 
“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.” 
“Oh yeah?” said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been 
bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point. 
“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?” 
inquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice. 
“Hmm, let’s think . . .” said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice, 
“maybe Lord Voldemort?” 
Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville 
slipped sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not 
flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on 
her face. 
“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.” 
The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either 
Umbridge or Harry. 
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.” 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 245  
Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubby-
fingered hands splayed on her desk. 
“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from 
the dead —” 
“He wasn’t dead,” said Harry angrily, “but yeah, he’s returned!” 
“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-
make-matters-worse-for-yourself,” said Professor Umbridge in one 
breath without looking at him. “As I was saying, you have been in-
formed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.” 
“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!” 
“Detention, Mr. Potter!” said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. 
“Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The 
Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any 
Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me 
outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn 
Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am 
your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page 
five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’” 
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry, how-
ever, stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-
scared, half-fascinated. 
“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at 
his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach. 
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own 
accord, did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking. 
There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of 
them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk 
about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died. They 
stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her 
eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face. 
“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she said coldly. 
“It was murder,” said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 246  
hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening 
classmates. “Voldemort killed him, and you know it.” 
Professor Umbridge’s face was quite blank. For a moment he 
thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest, 
most sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.” 
He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and 
up to the teacher’s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its 
breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next. 
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of 
her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bot-
tle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could 
not see what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she 
rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself 
seamlessly so that he could not open it. 
“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said Professor Um-
bridge, holding out the note to him. 
He took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not 
even looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the class-
room door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor, 
the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a cor-
ner walked slap into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide-faced little man 
floating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells. 
“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing two of the 
inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the 
walls with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl. 
“Get out of it, Peeves.” 
“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing Harry 
along the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. “What is it 
this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speak-
ing in” — Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry — “tongues?” 
“I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running down the  
 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 247  
nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his 
back beside him. 
 
“Oh, most think he’s barking, the Potty wee lad, 
 But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad, 
 But Peevesy knows better and says that he’s mad —” 
 
“SHUT UP!” 
A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged 
from her office looking grim and slightly harassed. 
“What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?” she snapped, as 
Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. “Why aren’t you in 
class?” 
“I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly. 
“Sent? What do you mean, sent?” 
He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGo-
nagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, 
stretched it out, and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side 
behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, 
and with each line they became narrower. 
“Come in here, Potter.” 
He followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically 
behind him. 
“Well?” said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. “Is this 
true?” 
“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had 
intended. “Professor?” he added in an attempt to sound more polite. 
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. 
“You called her a liar?” 
“Yes.” 
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE 
 248  
“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?” 
“Yes.” 
Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry. 
Then she said, “Have a biscuit, Potter.” 
“Have — what?” 
“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of 
cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. “And sit 
down.” 
There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be 
caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to 
the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and 
helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-
footed as he had done on that occasion. 
Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge’s note and 
looked very seriously at Harry. 
“Potter, you need to be careful.” 
Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her. 
Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk, 
crisp, and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more hu-
man than usual. 
“Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you much 
more than House points and a detention.” 
“What do you — ?” 
“Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor McGonagall, 
with an abrupt return to her usual manner. “You know where she 
comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting.” 
The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around 
came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move. 
“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, 
starting tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Um-
bridge’s note again. 
 
PROFESSOR  UMBRIDGE 
 249  
“Every evening this week!” Harry repeated, horrified. “But, Profes-
sor, couldn’t you — ?” 
“No, I couldn’t,” said Professor McGonagall flatly. 
“But —” 
“She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You 
will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one. Just re-
member: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.” 
“But I was telling the truth!” said Harry, outraged. “Voldemort’s 
back, you know he is, Professor Dumbledore knows he is —” 
“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straighten-
ing her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used 
Voldemort’s name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It’s 
about keeping your head down and your temper under control!” 
She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and he stood too. 
“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him. 
“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly. 
“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped. 
He took one. 
“Thanks,” he said grudgingly. 
“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-of-
term feast, Potter?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . she said . . . progress will be prohib-
ited or . . . well, it meant that . . . that the Ministry of Magic is trying 
to interfere at Hogwarts.” 
Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed, 
walked around her desk, and held open the door for him. 
“Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,” she 
said, pointing him out of her office.

DETENTION WITH 
DOLORES 
 
inner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experi-
ence for Harry. The news about his shouting match with 
Umbridge seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hog-
warts standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating 
between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the 
whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying 
about him — on the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he 
would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his 
story firsthand. 
“He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered. . . .” 
“He reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who. . . .” 
“Come off it. . . .” 
“Who does he think he’s kidding?” 
“Pur-lease . . .” 
“What I don’t get,” said Harry in a shaking voice, laying down his 
knife and fork (his hands were trembling too much to hold them 
steady), “is why they all believed the story two months ago when 
Dumbledore told them. . . .” 
D

“The thing is, Harry, I’m not sure they did,” said Hermione 
grimly. “Oh, let’s get out of here.” 
She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked sadly at his 
half-finished apple pie but followed suit. People stared at them all the 
way out of the Hall. 
“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed Dumbledore?” 
Harry asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing. 
“Look, you don’t understand what it was like after it happened,” 
said Hermione quietly. “You arrived back in the middle of the lawn 
clutching Cedric’s dead body. . . . None of us saw what happened in 
the maze. . . . We just had Dumbledore’s word for it that You-Know-
Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.” 
“Which is the truth!” said Harry loudly. 
“I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?” 
said Hermione wearily. “It’s just that before the truth could sink in, 
everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months 
reading about how you’re a nutcase and Dumbledore’s going senile!” 
Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty 
corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day 
had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do be-
fore bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He 
glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned 
into the Fat Lady’s corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid’s cabin. 
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Hermione, before the Fat Lady 
could ask. The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the 
three of them scrambled back through it. 
The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still 
down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and 
trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt 
lightly into Hermione’s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger 
cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted. 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 252  
“How can Dumbledore have let this happen?” Hermione cried sud-
denly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, look-
ing affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits 
of stuffing leaked out of the holes. “How can he let that terrible 
woman teach us? And in our O.W.L. year too!” 
“Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teach-
ers, have we?” said Harry. “You know what it’s like, Hagrid told us, 
nobody wants the job, they say it’s jinxed.” 
“Yes, but to employ someone who’s actually refusing to let us do 
magic! What’s Dumbledore playing at?” 
“And she’s trying to get people to spy for her,” said Ron darkly. “Re-
member when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear 
anyone saying You-Know-Who’s back?” 
“Of course she’s here to spy on us all, that’s obvious, why else would 
Fudge have wanted her to come?” snapped Hermione. 
“Don’t start arguing again,” said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his 
mouth to retaliate. “Can’t we just . . . Let’s just do that homework, get 
it out of the way. . . .” 
They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the 
chairs by the fire. People were coming back from dinner now. Harry 
kept his face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the 
stares he was attracting. 
“Shall we do Snape’s stuff first?” said Ron, dipping his quill into 
his ink. “ ‘The properties . . . of moonstone . . . and its uses . . . in potion-
making . . .’ ” he muttered, writing the words across the top of his 
parchment as he spoke them. “There.” He underlined the title, then 
looked up expectantly at Hermione. 
“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-
making?” 
But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far 
corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sit-
ting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom 
DETENTION  WITH 
DOLORES 
 253  
were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large pa-
per bag that Fred was holding. 
“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far,” she said, standing up and 
looking positively furious. “Come on, Ron.” 
“I — what?” said Ron, plainly playing for time. “No — come on, 
Hermione — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets. . . .” 
“You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat 
or — or Puking Pastilles or —” 
“Fainting Fancies?” Harry suggested quietly. 
One by one, as though hit over the heads with invisible mallets, the 
first years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right 
onto the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their 
tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Her-
mione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to 
where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing 
the unconscious first years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered 
uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, “She’s got 
it under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame 
permitted. 
“That’s enough!” Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George, 
both of whom looked up in mild surprise. 
“Yeah, you’re right,” said George, nodding, “this dosage looks 
strong enough, doesn’t it?” 
“I told you this morning, you can’t test your rubbish on students!” 
“We’re paying them!” said Fred indignantly. 
“I don’t care, it could be dangerous!” 
“Rubbish,” said Fred. 
“Calm down, Hermione, they’re fine!” said Lee reassuringly as he 
walked from first year to first year, inserting purple sweets into their 
open mouths. 
“Yeah, look, they’re coming round now,” said George. 
A few of the first years were indeed stirring. Several looked so 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 254  
shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their 
chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them 
what the sweets were going to do. 
“Feel all right?” said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying 
at his feet. 
“I-I think so,” she said shakily. 
“Excellent,” said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had 
snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies 
from his hands. 
“It is NOT excellent!” 
“ ’Course it is, they’re alive, aren’t they?” said Fred angrily. 
“You can’t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?” 
“We’re not going to make them ill, we’ve already tested them all on 
ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same —” 
“If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —” 
“Put us in detention?” said Fred in an I’d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice. 
“Make us write lines?” said George, smirking. 
Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself 
up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair 
seemed to crackle with electricity. 
“No,” she said, her voice quivering with anger, “but I will write to 
your mother.” 
“You wouldn’t,” said George, horrified, taking a step back from her. 
“Oh, yes, I would,” said Hermione grimly. “I can’t stop you eating 
the stupid things yourselves, but you’re not giving them to first years.” 
Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as 
they were concerned, Hermione’s threat was way below the belt. With 
a last threatening look at them, she thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag 
of Fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire. 
Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with 
his knees. 
 
DETENTION  WITH

 255  
“Thank you for your support, Ron,” Hermione said acidly. 
“You handled it fine by yourself,” Ron mumbled. 
Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few 
seconds, then said edgily, “Oh, it’s no good, I can’t concentrate now. 
I’m going to bed.” 
She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put 
her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly ob-
jects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them 
with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and 
stood back to admire the effect. 
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?” said Ron, watching 
her as though fearful for her sanity. 
“They’re hats for house-elves,” she said briskly, now stuffing her 
books back into her bag. “I did them over the summer. I’m a really 
slow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be 
able to make lots more.” 
“You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly. “And 
you’re covering them up with rubbish first?” 
“Yes,” said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto her back. 
“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily. “You’re trying to trick them into 
picking up the hats. You’re setting them free when they might not 
want to be free.” 
“Of course they want to be free!” said Hermione at once, though 
her face was turning pink. “Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron!” 
She left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to 
the girls’ dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats. 
“They should at least see what they’re picking up,” he said firmly. 
“Anyway . . .” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written 
the title of Snape’s essay. “There’s no point trying to finish this now, I 
can’t do it without Hermione, I haven’t got a clue what you’re sup-
posed to do with moonstones, have you?” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 256  
Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his 
right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant 
wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that 
he would regret not finishing his homework tonight when the morn-
ing came, he piled his books back into his bag. 
“I’m going to bed too.” 
He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormi-
tories, but did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that 
Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the 
soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure 
any more provocation. 
 
The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous 
one. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast. 
“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron bracingly. 
Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She 
looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her 
what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, “The hats have 
gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.” 
“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told her cuttingly. “They might not 
count as clothes. They didn’t look anything like hats to me, more like 
woolly bladders.” 
Hermione did not speak to him all morning. 
Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Profes-
sor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen 
minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of 
O.W.L.s. 
“What you must remember,” said little Professor Flitwick squeak-
ily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top 
of his desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for 
many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to 
your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I’m 
DETENTION  WITH

 257  
afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do 
yourselves justice!” 
They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, 
which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their 
O.W.L., and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest 
amount of Charms homework ever. 
It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration. 
“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor McGonagall grimly, 
“without serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why 
everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration 
as long as they put in the work.” Neville made a sad little disbeliev-
ing noise. “Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. 
“There’s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So 
. . . today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Con-
juring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. 
level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be 
tested on in your O.W.L.” 
She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly dif-
ficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed 
to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said 
hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the 
other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earn-
ing her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. 
She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told 
to practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails 
the following afternoon. 
Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had 
to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up 
the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron’s slur 
on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they 
reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry’s head was 
aching again. 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 258  
The day had become cool and breezy, and, as they walked down 
the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden 
Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor 
Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Ha-
grid’s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many 
twigs. As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter 
sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding to-
ward them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had 
clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, 
Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they 
gathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact that all of them 
kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke 
without too much difficulty. 
“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the 
Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. “Let’s crack on then — who 
can tell me what these things are called?” 
She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione’s hand 
shot into the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imita-
tion of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question. 
Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once 
into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed 
themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of 
wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at 
the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair 
of beetle-brown eyes glittered. 
“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry: 
Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impres-
sive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but 
the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the 
Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so. 
“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor Grubbly-
Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice 
DETENTION  WITH 
DOLORES 
 259  
among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food. 
“So — anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?” 
“Bowtruckles,” said Hermione. “They’re tree-guardians, usually 
live in wand-trees.” 
“Five points for Gryffindor,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Yes, these 
are bowtruckles and, as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in 
trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?” 
“Wood lice,” said Hermione promptly, which explained why what 
Harry had taken for grains of brown rice were moving. “But fairy eggs 
if they can get them.” 
“Good girl, take another five points. So whenever you need leaves 
or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a 
gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look 
dangerous, but if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their 
fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable 
near the eyeballs. So if you’d like to gather closer, take a few wood lice 
and a bowtruckle — I have enough here for one between three — you 
can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all 
body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.” 
The class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately 
circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor 
Grubbly-Plank. 
“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else was choosing 
bowtruckles. 
“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, 
which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for 
a class too. Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned 
across Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle. 
“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could 
hear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.” 
“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said Harry out of the side of 
his mouth. 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 260  
“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you 
get my drift.” 
Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who sud-
denly felt sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death 
Eater, after all; what if he had information about Hagrid’s fate that 
had not yet reached the Order’s ears? He hurried back around the 
table to Ron and Hermione, who were squatting on the grass some 
distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still 
long enough to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill, 
crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what Mal-
foy had just said. 
“Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,” 
said Hermione at once. “It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look 
worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got 
to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just 
so I can draw its face. . . .” 
“Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear drawl from the group nearest them, 
“Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you 
know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to 
crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that over-
grown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing 
straight away.” 
“OUCH!” 
Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost 
snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its 
sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it; 
Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Ha-
grid being sacked, laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full 
tilt toward the forest, a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by 
the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds Harry 
rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to  
 
DETENTION  WITH 
DOLORES 
 261  
Herbology with his hand wrapped in a handkerchief of Hermione’s 
and Malfoy’s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears. 
“If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time . . .” snarled Harry. 
“Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a pre-
fect now, he could make life difficult for you. . . .” 
“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said Harry 
sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together they 
traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to 
make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not. 
“I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that’s all,” said 
Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. “And don’t say 
that Grubbly-Plank woman’s a better teacher!” he added threateningly. 
“I wasn’t going to,” said Hermione calmly. 
“Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid,” said Harry firmly, fully 
aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical 
Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it. 
The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth years 
spilled out of it, including Ginny. 
“Hi,” she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna 
Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of 
earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. 
When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly 
and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates 
turned curiously to watch. Luna took a great breath and then said, 
without so much as a preliminary hello: “I believe He-Who-Must-
Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped 
from him.” 
“Er — right,” said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what 
looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati 
and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and 
pointing at her earlobes. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 262  
“You can laugh!” Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the 
impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had 
said rather than what she was wearing. “But people used to believe there 
were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-
Horned Snorkack!” 
“Well, they were right, weren’t they?” said Hermione impatiently. 
“There weren’t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the 
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.” 
Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swing-
ing madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with 
laughter now. 
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?” 
Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class. 
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than her,” said 
Hermione. “Ginny’s told me all about her, apparently she’ll only be-
lieve in things as long as there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect 
anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.” 
Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the 
night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too. 
His spirits sank slightly. Had she been lying? But before he could de-
vote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped 
up to him. 
“I want you to know, Potter,” he said in a loud, carrying voice, “that 
it’s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one 
hundred percent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumble-
dore, and so do I.” 
“Er — thanks very much, Ernie,” said Harry, taken aback but 
pleased. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry 
was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from some-
body who was not wearing radishes in their ears. Ernie’s words had 
certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown’s face and, as he  
 
DETENTION  WITH

 263  
turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus’s expres-
sion, which looked both confused and defiant. 
To nobody’s surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lec-
turing them about the importance of O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the 
teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious, 
twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much 
homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when 
Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired 
and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout’s preferred 
brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an 
hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been an-
other long day. 
As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Um-
bridge at five o’clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping 
off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down 
before facing whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached 
the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice 
said, “Oy, Potter!” 
“What now?” he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina John-
son, who looked as though she was in a towering temper. 
“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to him and 
poking him hard in the chest with her finger. “How come you’ve 
landed yourself in detention for five o’clock on Friday?” 
“What?” said Harry. “Why . . . oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!” 
“Now he remembers!” snarled Angelina. “Didn’t I tell you I wanted 
to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in 
with everyone? Didn’t I tell you I’d booked the Quidditch pitch spe-
cially? And now you’ve decided you’re not going to be there!” 
“I didn’t decide not to be there!” said Harry, stung by the injustice 
of these words. “I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just be-
cause I told her the truth about You-Know-Who —” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 264  
“Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on 
Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “and I don’t care how you do it, tell her 
You-Know-Who’s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make 
sure you’re there!” 
She stormed away. 
“You know what?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they en-
tered the Great Hall. “I think we’d better check with Puddlemere 
United whether Oliver Wood’s been killed during a training session, 
because she seems to be channeling his spirit.” 
“What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on 
Friday?” said Ron skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table. 
“Less than zero,” said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops onto his 
plate and starting to eat. “Better try, though, hadn’t I? I’ll offer to do 
two more detentions or something, I dunno. . . .” He swallowed a 
mouthful of potato and added, “I hope she doesn’t keep me too long 
this evening. You realize we’ve got to write three essays, practice Van-
ishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a countercharm for Flitwick, 
finish the bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream diary for 
Trelawney?” 
Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling. 
“And it looks like it’s going to rain.” 
“What’s that got to do with our homework?” said Hermione, her 
eyebrows raised. 
“Nothing,” said Ron at once, his ears reddening. 
At five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and set off for 
Umbridge’s office on the third floor. When he knocked on the door 
she said, “Come in,” in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking 
around. 
He had known this office under three of its previous occupants. In 
the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered 
in beaming portraits of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was 
likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or

tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody’s days it had been 
packed with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of 
wrongdoing and concealment. 
Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had 
all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full 
of dried flowers, each residing on its own doily, and on one of the 
walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a 
large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. 
These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Profes-
sor Umbridge spoke again. 
“Good evening, Mr. Potter.” 
Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first 
because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended 
only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her. 
“Evening,” Harry said stiffly. 
“Well, sit down,” she said, pointing toward a small table draped in 
lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of 
blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him. 
“Er,” said Harry, without moving. “Professor Umbridge? Er — 
before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a . . . a favor.” 
Her bulging eyes narrowed. 
“Oh yes?” 
“Well I’m . . . I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was 
supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Fri-
day and I was — was wondering whether I could skip detention that 
night and do it — do it another night . . . instead . . .” 
He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was 
no good. 
“Oh no,” said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as 
though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. “Oh no, no, no. 
This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking 
stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to

suit the guilty one’s convenience. No, you will come here at five 
o’clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will 
do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you 
are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the 
lesson I am trying to teach you.” 
Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise 
in his ears. So he told evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, did he? 
She was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smil-
ing widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was 
waiting to see whether he would start shouting again. With a massive 
effort Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the 
straight-backed chair, and sat down. 
“There,” said Umbridge sweetly, “we’re getting better at controlling 
our temper already, aren’t we? Now, you are going to be doing some 
lines for me, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry 
bent down to open his bag. “You’re going to be using a rather special 
one of mine. Here you are.” 
She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp 
point. 
“I want you to write ‘I must not tell lies,’” she told him softly. 
“How many times?” Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of 
politeness. 
“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,” said Umbridge 
sweetly. “Off you go.” 
She moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of 
parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp 
black quill and then realized what was missing. 
“You haven’t given me any ink,” he said. 
“Oh, you won’t need ink,” said Professor Umbridge with the mer-
est suggestion of a laugh in her voice. 
Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must 
not tell lies. 
DETENTION  WITH 
DOLORES 
 267  
He let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parch-
ment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the 
words had appeared on the back of Harry’s right hand, cut into his 
skin as though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as he stared at the 
shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had 
been slightly redder than before but quite smooth. 
Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her 
wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile. 
“Yes?” 
“Nothing,” said Harry quietly. 
He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once 
more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of 
his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his 
skin, once again they healed over seconds later. 
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the 
parchment in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own 
blood. And again and again the words were cut into the back of his 
hand, healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill to 
parchment. 
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when 
he would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He 
knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not go-
ing to show any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open 
his own hand with this quill. . . . 
“Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours. 
He stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked 
down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was 
red raw. 
“Hand,” she said. 
He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder 
as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore 
a number of ugly old rings. 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 268  
“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,” 
she said, smiling. “Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow 
evening, won’t we? You may go.” 
Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted; 
it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor then, 
when he had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear 
him, broke into a run. 
 
He had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had not written a 
single dream in his dream diary, and had not finished the drawing of 
the bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast 
next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Div-
ination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron 
keeping him company. 
“How come you didn’t do it last night?” Harry asked, as Ron stared 
wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been 
fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered some-
thing about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his parchment, and 
scrawled a few words. 
“That’ll have to do,” he said, slamming the diary shut, “I’ve said I 
dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can’t make anything 
weird out of that, can she?” 
They hurried off to North Tower together. 
“How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make 
you do?” 
Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, “Lines.” 
“That’s not too bad, then, eh?” said Ron. 
“Nope,” said Harry. 
“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?” 
“No,” said Harry. 
Ron groaned sympathetically. 
It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Trans-

 269  
figuration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give 
up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and 
meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave 
them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that 
evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, 
Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning 
that he would not be able to attend Friday’s Keeper tryouts, told him 
she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected play-
ers who wished to remain on the team to put training before their 
other commitments. 
“I’m in detention!” Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. 
“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or play-
ing Quidditch?” 
“At least it’s only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank 
back onto his bench and looked down at his steak-and-kidney pie, 
which he no longer fancied very much. “It’s not as if it’s a dreadful 
punishment, really. . . .” 
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. He was not 
really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was 
happening in Umbridge’s room: He only knew that he did not want 
to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem 
worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this 
was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he 
was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had com-
plained about it. 
“I can’t believe how much homework we’ve got,” said Ron 
miserably. 
“Well, why didn’t you do any last night?” Hermione asked him. 
“Where were you anyway?” 
“I was . . . I fancied a walk,” said Ron shiftily. 
Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in con-
cealing things at the moment. 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 270  
 
         
The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on 
the back of Harry’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and 
inflamed; Harry thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for 
long. Soon the cut would remain etched in his hand and Umbridge 
would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no moan of pain escape him, how-
ever, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his 
dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but “Good evening” 
and “Good night.” 
His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when 
he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though ex-
hausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape’s moon-
stone essay. It was half-past two by the time he had finished it. He 
knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he 
had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next. 
He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall 
had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of 
bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, 
where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep 
immediately. 
Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too, 
though Harry could not see why he should be. Harry’s third detention 
passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two 
hours the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the back of 
Harry’s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. 
The pause in the pointed quill’s scratching made Professor Umbridge 
look up. 
“Ah,” she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand 
herself. “Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn’t it? 
You may leave for tonight.” 
 
DETENTION  WITH

 271  
“Do I still have to come back tomorrow?” said Harry, picking up 
his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right. 
“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as before. “Yes, 
I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s 
work.” 
He had never before considered the possibility that there might be 
another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he 
walked back toward Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found 
a contender. She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the sev-
enth floor, she’s an evil, twisted, mad, old — 
“Ron?” 
He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost 
walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the 
Lanky, clutching his broomstick. He gave a great leap of surprise 
when he saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven 
behind his back. 
“What are you doing?” 
“Er — nothing. What are you doing?” 
Harry frowned at him. 
“Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?” 
“I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,” said 
Ron. “They just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet they’re 
testing stuff on them again, I mean, they can’t do it in the common 
room now, can they, not with Hermione there.” 
He was talking in a very fast, feverish way. 
“But what have you got your broom for, you haven’t been flying, 
have you?” Harry asked. 
“I — well — well, okay, I’ll tell you, but don’t laugh, all right?” Ron 
said defensively, turning redder with every second. “I-I thought I’d try 
out for Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on. 
Laugh.” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 272  
“I’m not laughing,” said Harry. Ron blinked. “It’s a brilliant idea! 
It’d be really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you play 
Keeper, are you good?” 
“I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry’s 
reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for them 
when they were training during the holidays.” 
“So you’ve been practicing tonight?” 
“Every evening since Tuesday . . . just on my own, though, I’ve 
been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn’t been easy 
and I don’t know how much use it’ll be.” Ron looked nervous and 
anxious. “Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when 
I turn up for the tryouts. They haven’t stopped taking the mickey out 
of me since I got made a prefect.” 
“I wish I was going to be there,” said Harry bitterly, as they set off 
together toward the common room. 
“Yeah, so do — Harry, what’s that on the back of your hand?” 
Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, 
tried to hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep. 
“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s —” 
But Ron had grabbed Harry’s forearm and pulled the back of 
Harry’s hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which 
he stared at the words carved into the skin, then he released Harry, 
looking sick. 
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?” 
Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he 
told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Um-
bridge’s office. 
“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt 
in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head 
against her frame. “She’s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!” 
“No,” said Harry at once. “I’m not giving her the satisfaction of 
knowing she’s got to me.” 
DETENTION  WITH 
DOLORES 
 273  
“Got to you? You can’t let her get away with this!” 
“I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over her,” said 
Harry. 
“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!” 
“No,” said Harry flatly. 
“Why not?” 
“He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that was not the 
true reason. He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when 
Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since last June. 
“Well, I reckon you should —” Ron began, but he was interrupted 
by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst 
out, “Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay 
awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?” 
 
Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though 
Harry glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered 
the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he 
turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as 
the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of 
yet another detention with Umbridge. 
Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it 
was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final 
detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the 
Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to 
see something of Ron’s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it 
was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his 
present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at 
Hogwarts. 
At five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge’s 
office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was 
told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on 
the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it. 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 274  
“You know what to do, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, smiling 
sweetly over at him. 
Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he 
just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right . . . On the pretext of 
shifting himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a dis-
tant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the 
pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three 
high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impos-
sible to tell which one was Ron at this distance. 
I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right 
hand opened and began to bleed afresh. 
I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting. 
I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist. 
He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was de-
fending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie 
Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very 
much that the Keeper wasn’t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the 
parchment dotted with blood. 
I must not tell lies. 
I must not tell lies. 
He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it, when he could 
hear the scratching of Umbridge’s quill or the opening of a desk 
drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was 
terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fum-
bled an easy save. The sky was darkening so that Harry doubted he 
would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all. 
I must not tell lies. 
I must not tell lies. 
The parchment was now shining with drops of blood from the back 
of his hand, which was searing with pain. When he next looked up, 
night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible.

“Let’s see if you’ve gotten the message yet, shall we?” said Um-
bridge’s soft voice half an hour later. 
She moved toward him, stretching out her short be-ringed fingers 
for his arm. And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words 
now cut into his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but 
across the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most pe-
culiar sensation somewhere around his midriff. 
He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at 
her. She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth. 
“Yes, it hurts, doesn’t it?” she said softly. 
He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was 
she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his 
forehead? 
“Well, I think I’ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.” 
He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he 
could. 
Stay calm, he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it 
doesn’t necessarily mean what you think it means. . . . 
“Mimbulus mimbletonia!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung 
forward once more. 
A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running toward him, 
beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from 
the goblet he was clutching. 
“Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper!” 
“What? Oh — brilliant!” said Harry, trying to smile naturally, 
while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled. 
“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto him. “I can’t believe 
it — where’s Hermione gone?” 
“She’s there,” said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and 
pointed to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her 
drink tipping precariously in her hand. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 276  
“Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,” said Ron, looking 
slightly put out. 
“Let her sleep,” said George hastily. It was a few moments before 
Harry noticed that several of the first years gathered around them bore 
unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds. 
“Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver’s old robes fit you,” called Katie 
Bell. “We can take off his name and put yours on instead. . . .” 
As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry. 
“Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,” she said abruptly. 
“It’s stressful, this managing lark, you know, I’m starting to think I 
was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.” She was watching Ron over the 
rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face. 
“Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not fabulous,” she said 
bluntly. “I think with a bit of training he’ll be all right, though. He 
comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I’m banking on him 
turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to 
be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better 
this evening, but Hooper’s a real whiner, he’s always moaning about 
something or other, and Vicky’s involved in all sorts of societies, she 
admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she’d 
put Charms first. Anyway, we’re having a practice session at two 
o’clock tomorrow, so just make sure you’re there this time. And do me 
a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?” 
He nodded and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry 
moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put 
down his bag. 
“Oh, Harry, it’s you. . . . Good about Ron, isn’t it?” she said 
blearily. “I’m just so — so — so tired,” she yawned. “I was up until 
one o’clock making more hats. They’re disappearing like mad!” 
And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were 
woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might 
accidentally pick them up. 
DETENTION  WITH

 277  
“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, 
he would burst. “Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge’s office 
and she touched my arm . . .” 
Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished she said 
slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know-Who’s controlling her like he 
controlled Quirrell?” 
“Well,” said Harry, dropping his voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?” 
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. 
“But I don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quir-
rell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own 
body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s. He could have her un-
der the Imperius Curse, I suppose. . . .” 
Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty but-
terbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, “But last year 
your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumble-
dore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the 
time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got anything to do with Umbridge at 
all, maybe it’s just coincidence it happened while you were with her?” 
“She’s evil,” said Harry flatly. “Twisted.” 
“She’s horrible, yes, but . . . Harry, I think you ought to tell Dum-
bledore your scar hurt.” 
It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to 
Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his an-
swer to Ron. 
“I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it’s not a big 
deal. It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse 
tonight, that’s all —” 
“Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by 
this —” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, “that’s the only bit 
of me Dumbledore cares about, isn’t it, my scar?” 
“Don’t say that, it’s not true!” 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN 
 278  
“I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks —” 
“Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter!” said 
Hermione, looking alarmed. “Don’t you remember, Moody told us to 
be careful what we put in writing! We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t 
being intercepted anymore!” 
“All right, all right, I won’t tell him, then!” said Harry irritably. He 
got to his feet. “I’m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?” 
“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking relieved, “if you’re going that 
means I can go without being rude too, I’m absolutely exhausted and 
I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if 
you like, it’s quite fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and bob-
bles and all sorts of things now.” 
Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried 
to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer. 
“Er . . . no, I don’t think I will, thanks,” he said. “Er — not tomor-
row. I’ve got loads of homework to do. . . .” 
And he traipsed off to the boys’ stairs, leaving her looking slightly 
disappointed behind him.

arry was the first to awake in his dormitory next morning. 
He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of 
sunlight falling through the gap in his four-poster’s hangings and sa-
vored the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed 
to have dragged on forever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson. 
Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that 
beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the cur-
tains around his bed, got up, and started to dress. The only sound 
apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing 
of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled 
out parchment and quill, and headed out of the dormitory for the 
common room. 
Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the 
now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and un-
rolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of 
crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars, 
and candy wrappers that usually covered the common room at the 
end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione’s elf hats. Wondering 
H 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN

vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted 
to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, 
and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish sur-
face of his parchment, thinking hard. . . . But after a minute or so he 
found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what 
to say. 
He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and 
Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he sup-
posed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week 
and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving po-
tential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to 
have? 
He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, 
finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle 
once more and set it resolutely upon the parchment. 
 
Dear Snuffles, 
Hope you’re okay, the first week back here’s been terrible, I’m 
really glad it’s the weekend. 
We’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Pro-
fessor Umbridge. She’s nearly as nice as your mum. I’m writing 
because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened 
again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge. 
We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be back soon. 
Please write back quickly. 
Best, 
 
 
 
Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see it from the point 
of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what 
he was talking about — or who he was talking to — just from reading 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 281  
this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid 
and tell them when he might be back: Harry did not want to ask di-
rectly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up 
to while he was not at Hogwarts. 
Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to 
write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been 
working on it, and he could now hear distant sounds of movement 
from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully he 
climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery. 
“I would not go that way if I were you,” said Nearly Headless Nick, 
drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of him as he walked 
down the passage. “Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next 
person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.” 
“Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person’s head?” 
asked Harry. 
“Funnily enough, it does,” said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored 
voice. “Subtlety has never been Peeves’s strong point. I’m off to try 
and find the Bloody Baron. . . . He might be able to put a stop to it. 
. . . See you, Harry. . . .” 
“Yeah, ’bye,” said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, 
taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he 
walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had 
training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last — 
Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the care-
taker’s skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, slinking past him. She turned 
lamplike yellow eyes upon him for a moment before disappearing be-
hind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful. 
“I’m not doing anything wrong,” Harry called after her. She had 
the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet 
Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the 
Owlery on a Saturday morning. 
The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 282  
Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of 
sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nes-
tled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly 
just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little 
as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of 
Hedwig. 
“There you are,” he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top 
of the vaulted ceiling. “Get down here, I’ve got a letter for you.” 
With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared 
down onto his shoulder. 
“Right, I know this says ‘Snuffles’ on the outside,” he told her, giv-
ing her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly 
why, whispering, “but it’s for Sirius, okay?” 
She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she 
understood. 
“Safe flight, then,” said Harry and he carried her to one of the win-
dows; with a moment’s pressure on his arm Hedwig took off into the 
blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black 
speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid’s hut, clearly vis-
ible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney 
smokeless, the curtains drawn. 
The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. 
Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about 
Quidditch later . . . and then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged 
horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery 
black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl’s, rose up out of the trees 
like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle and then plunged 
once more into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly 
Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was 
hammering madly. 
The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock, and turn-
ing quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands. 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 283  
“Hi,” said Harry automatically. 
“Oh . . . hi,” she said breathlessly. “I didn’t think anyone would be 
up here this early. . . . I only remembered five minutes ago, it’s my 
mum’s birthday.” 
She held up the parcel. 
“Right,” said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted 
to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terri-
ble winged horse was fresh in his mind. 
“Nice day,” he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed 
to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the 
weather. . . . 
“Yeah,” said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. “Good Quid-
ditch conditions. I haven’t been out all week, have you?” 
“No,” said Harry. 
Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down 
onto her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach 
the parcel. 
“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she asked. 
“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s my friend Ron Weasley, d’you know him?” 
“The Tornado-hater?” said Cho rather coolly. “Is he any good?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, “I think so. I didn’t see his tryout, though, I was 
in detention.” 
Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl’s legs. 
“That Umbridge woman’s foul,” she said in a low voice. “Putting 
you in detention just because you told the truth about how — how 
— how he died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school. 
You were really brave standing up to her like that.” 
Harry’s insides reinflated so rapidly he felt as though he might ac-
tually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared 
about a stupid flying horse, Cho thought he had been really brave. . . . 
For a moment he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his 
cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel onto her owl. . . . But the very 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 284  
instant that this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened 
again. 
Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. There were pur-
ple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and 
his thin gray hair disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris 
came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing 
hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above, and a large 
brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion. 
“Aha!” said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, his 
pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve had a tip-off that you are 
intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!” 
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker. 
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?” 
Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl 
on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but 
she ignored it. 
“I have my sources,” said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. “Now hand 
over whatever it is you’re sending.” 
Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off 
the letter, Harry said, “I can’t, it’s gone.” 
“Gone?” said Filch, his face contorting with rage. 
“Gone,” said Harry calmly. 
Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then 
raked Harry’s robes with his eyes. “How do I know you haven’t got it 
in your pocket?” 
“Because —” 
“I saw him send it,” said Cho angrily. 
Filch rounded on her. 
“You saw him — ?” 
“That’s right, I saw him,” she said fiercely. 
There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho  
 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 285  
glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward 
the door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at 
Harry. 
“If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . . .” 
He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing 
look at the owls and followed him. 
Harry and Cho looked at each other. 
“Thanks,” Harry said. 
“No problem,” said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl’s 
other leg, her face slightly pink. “You weren’t ordering Dungbombs, 
were you?” 
“No,” said Harry. 
“I wonder why he thought you were, then?” she said, as she carried 
the owl to the window. 
Harry shrugged; he was quite as mystified by that as she was, 
though, oddly, it was not bothering him very much at the moment. 
They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led 
toward the west wing of the castle, Cho said, “I’m going this way. 
Well, I’ll . . . I’ll see you around, Harry.” 
“Yeah . . . see you.” 
She smiled at him and departed. He walked on, feeling quietly 
elated. He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and 
not embarrassed himself once. . . . You were really brave standing up to 
her like that. . . . She had called him brave. . . . She did not hate him 
for being alive. . . . 
Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that. . . . Though if 
he’d only asked her to the ball before Cedric had, things might have 
turned out differently. . . . She had seemed sincerely sorry that she 
had to refuse when Harry had asked her. . . . 
“Morning,” Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, joining 
them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. 
 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 286  
“What are you looking so pleased about?” said Ron, eyeing Harry 
in surprise. 
“Erm . . . Quidditch later,” said Harry happily, pulling a large plat-
ter of bacon and eggs toward him. 
“Oh . . . yeah . . .” said Ron. He put down the bit of toast he was 
eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, “Listen 
. . . you don’t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to — 
er — give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get 
my eye in a bit . . .” 
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. 
“Look, I don’t think you should,” said Hermione seriously, “you’re 
both really behind on homework as it —” 
But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the 
Daily Prophet was soaring toward her in the beak of a screech owl, 
which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; 
Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, 
and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off again. 
“Anything interesting?” said Ron; Harry smiled — he knew Ron 
was keen to get her off the subject of homework. 
“No,” she sighed, “just some guff about the bass player in the 
Weird Sisters getting married. . . .” 
She opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted 
himself to another helping of eggs and bacon; Ron was staring up at 
the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied. 
“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly. “Oh no . . . Sirius!” 
“What’s happened?” said Harry, and he snatched at the paper so 
violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione 
were holding half each. 
“ ‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source 
that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is cur-
rently hiding in London!’ ” Hermione read from her half in an anguished 
whisper. 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 287  
“Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything,” said Harry in a low, furious 
voice. “He did recognize Sirius on the platform. . . .” 
“What?” said Ron, looking alarmed. “You didn’t say —” 
“Shh!” said the other two. 
“. . . ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very danger-
ous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban . . .’ the usual 
rubbish,” Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and 
looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. “Well, he just won’t be able to 
leave the house again, that’s all,” she whispered. “Dumbledore did 
warn him not to.” 
Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off. 
Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame 
Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale. 
“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could 
both see it. “Look at this!” 
“I’ve got all the robes I want,” said Ron. 
“No,” said Harry, “look . . . this little piece here . . .” 
Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an 
inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column. It was head-
lined: 
 
TRESPASS AT MINISTRY 
Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum 
Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the 
Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted 
robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August. 
Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watch-
wizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to 
force his way through a top-security door at one 
o’clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to 
speak in his own defense, was convicted on both 
charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban. 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 288  
“Sturgis Podmore?” said Ron slowly, “but he’s that bloke who looks 
like his head’s been thatched, isn’t he? He’s one of the Ord —” 
“Ron, shh!” said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them. 
“Six months in Azkaban!” whispered Harry, shocked. “Just for try-
ing to get through a door!” 
“Don’t be silly, it wasn’t just for trying to get through a door — 
what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in 
the morning?” breathed Hermione. 
“D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order?” Ron 
muttered. 
“Wait a moment. . . .” said Harry slowly. “Sturgis was supposed to 
come and see us off, remember?” 
The other two looked at him. 
“Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King’s 
Cross, remember? And Moody was all annoyed because he didn’t turn 
up, so that doesn’t seem like he was supposed to be on a job for them, 
does it?” 
“Well, maybe they didn’t expect him to get caught,” said 
Hermione. 
“It could be a frame-up!” Ron exclaimed excitedly. “No — listen!” 
he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look 
on Hermione’s face. “The Ministry suspects he’s one of Dumbledore’s 
lot so — I dunno — they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn’t 
trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they’ve just made some-
thing up to get him!” 
There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this. 
Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand, 
looked rather impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all 
surprised if that were true.” 
She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. When Harry 
laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie. 
 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 289  
“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-
Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start McGo-
nagall’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch. . . .” 
Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of 
homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating 
blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week. . . . 
“I mean, we can do it tonight,” said Ron, as he and Harry walked 
down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broom-
sticks over their shoulders, Hermione’s dire warnings that they would 
fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears. “And we’ve got tomor-
row. She gets too worked up about work, that’s her trouble. . . .” There 
was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, “D’you 
think she meant it when she said we weren’t copying from her?” 
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. “Still, this is important too, we’ve got to 
practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team. . . .” 
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we have got 
plenty of time to do it all. . . .” 
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch 
pitch, to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. 
Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant 
owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry 
about; the flying horse wasn’t doing him any harm: He pushed it out 
of his mind. 
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and 
set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing 
Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron 
was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry at-
tempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced. 
After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate 
lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought 
they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the  
 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 290  
real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in 
the changing room when they entered. 
“All right, Ron?” said George, winking at him. 
“Yeah,” said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way 
down to the pitch. 
“Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?” said Fred, emerging 
tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly mali-
cious grin on his face. 
“Shut up,” said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes 
for the first time. They fitted him well considering they had been 
Oliver Wood’s, who was rather broader in the shoulder. 
“Okay everyone,” said Angelina, entering from the Captain’s office, 
already changed. “Let’s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring 
the ball crate out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there 
watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right?” 
Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he 
might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, 
when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch 
it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch 
team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the 
empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium. 
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. 
“Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like 
that?” 
Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with 
laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground 
and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind. 
“Ignore them,” he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. “We’ll 
see who’s laughing after we play them. . . .” 
“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina approvingly, 
soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to 
hover on the spot in front of her airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 291  
going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team 
please —” 
“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that hairstyle anyway?” shrieked Pansy 
Parkinson from below. “Why would anyone want to look like they’ve 
got worms coming out of their head?” 
Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and said 
calmly, “Spread out, then, and let’s see what we can do. . . .” 
Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. 
Ron fell back toward the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle 
with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who 
passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it. 
The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. 
Ron, who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it 
landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on 
his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred 
and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them 
said anything, for which he was grateful. 
“Pass it on, Ron,” called Angelina, as though nothing had happened. 
Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who 
passed to George. . . . 
“Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called Malfoy. “Sure you 
don’t need a lie-down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were 
in the hospital wing, that’s a record for you, isn’t it?” 
Fred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, who had not 
been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and 
passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches. 
“Come on now, Ron,” said Angelina crossly, as Ron dived for the 
ground again, chasing the Quaffle. “Pay attention.” 
It would have been hard to say whether Ron’s face or the Quaffle 
was a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height. Malfoy 
and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter. 
On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 292  
he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through 
Katie’s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face. 
“Sorry!” Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether he had 
done any damage. 
“Get back in position, she’s fine!” barked Angelina. “But as you’re 
passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won’t 
you? We’ve got Bludgers for that!” 
Katie’s nose was bleeding. Down below the Slytherins were stamp-
ing their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie. 
“Here, take this,” Fred told her, handing her something small and 
purple from out of his pocket. “It’ll clear it up in no time.” 
“All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats 
and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch 
when I say so. We’re going to aim for Ron’s goal, obviously.” 
Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch. 
“Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered 
George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls 
and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch. 
“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. “He was fine when I was practicing 
with him this morning.” 
“Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon,” said Fred gloomily. 
They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry 
released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that 
moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It 
was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth 
a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker’s team and doing so required 
enormous speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and 
out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face and the 
distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears. 
. . . But too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again. 
“Stop — stop – STOP!” screamed Angelina. “Ron — you’re not 
covering your middle post!” 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 293  
Harry looked around at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-
hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected. 
“Oh . . . sorry . . .” 
“You keep shifting around while you’re watching the Chasers!” said 
Angelina. “Either stay in center position until you have to move to de-
fend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one 
side, that’s how you let in the last three goals!” 
“Sorry . . .” Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against 
the bright blue sky. 
“And Katie, can’t you do something about that nosebleed?” 
“It’s just getting worse!” said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the 
flow with her sleeve. 
Harry glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and check-
ing his pockets. He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it 
for a second, and then look around at Katie, evidently horrorstruck. 
“Well, let’s try again,” said Angelina. She was ignoring the Slyth-
erins, who had now set up a chant of “Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor  
are losers,” but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom 
nevertheless. 
This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when 
Angelina’s whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch 
circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved. 
“What now?” he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest. 
“Katie,” she said shortly. 
Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, and George all flying as fast 
as they could toward Katie. Harry and Alicia sped toward her too. It 
was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was 
now chalk-white and covered in blood. 
“She needs the hospital wing,” said Angelina. 
“We’ll take her,” said Fred. “She — er — might have swallowed a 
Blood Blisterpod by mistake —” 
“Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 294  
gone,” said Angelina glumly, as Fred and George zoomed off toward 
the castle supporting Katie between them. “Come on, let’s go and get 
changed.” 
The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the 
changing rooms. 
“How was practice?” asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour 
later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the 
Gryffindor common room. 
“It was —” Harry began. 
“Completely lousy,” said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair 
beside Hermione. She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to 
melt. 
“Well, it was only your first one,” she said consolingly, “it’s bound 
to take time to —” 
“Who said it was me who made it lousy?” snapped Ron. 
“No one,” said Hermione, looking taken aback, “I thought —” 
“You thought I was bound to be rubbish?” 
“No, of course I didn’t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just —” 
“I’m going to get started on some homework,” said Ron angrily 
and stomped off to the staircase to the boys’ dormitories and vanished 
from sight. Hermione turned to Harry. 
“Was he lousy?” 
“No,” said Harry loyally. 
Hermione raised her eyebrows. 
“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” Harry muttered, “but 
it was only the first training session, like you said. . . .” 
Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their 
homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with 
how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself 
was having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out 
of his head. 
They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 295  
their books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It 
was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent 
the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the 
last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody 
had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull. 
“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done 
during the week,” Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside 
Professor McGonagall’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell 
and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra’s equally long and difficult 
essay about Jupiter’s moons. 
“Yeah,” said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his 
fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. “Listen . . . 
shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she’s done?” 
Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her 
lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed 
in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks. 
“No,” he said heavily, “you know she won’t let us.” 
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became 
steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin 
again. At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, 
yawning. 
“Nearly done?” 
“No,” said Ron shortly. 
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” she said, 
pointing over Ron’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s 
Io that’s got the volcanos.” 
“Thanks,” snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences. 
“Sorry, I only —” 
“Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize —” 
“Ron —” 
“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m 
up to my neck in it here —” 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 296  
“No — look!” 
Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron 
both looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the win-
dowsill, gazing into the room at Ron. 
“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding amazed. 
“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and get-
ting to his feet. “What’s Percy writing to me for?” 
He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, 
landed upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was at-
tached. Ron took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky 
footprints across Ron’s drawing of the moon Io. 
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, sinking back into 
his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To 
Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the other 
two. “What d’you reckon?” 
“Open it!” said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded. 
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther down the 
parchment his eyes traveled, the more pronounced became his scowl. 
When he had finished reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the let-
ter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned toward each other to read it 
together: 
 
Dear Ron, 
I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister 
of Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor 
Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect. 
I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and 
must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have al-
ways been afraid that you would take what we might call the 
“Fred and George” route, rather than following in my footsteps, so 
you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting 
authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility. 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 297  
But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I 
want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at 
night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully you will 
be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward 
questions. 
From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are 
now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Pot-
ter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of 
losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that 
boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you 
will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite — but 
I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at 
Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very dif-
ferent — and probably more accurate — view of Potters behav-
ior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet 
tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blow-
ing — and see if you can spot yours truly! 
Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same 
brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future 
prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you 
must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Pot-
ter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole 
Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He 
got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the peo-
ple I’ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt. 
It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter — I 
know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent — 
but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything 
else in Potter’s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak 
to Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know 
will be only too happy to advise you. 
This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 298  
above, Dumbledore’s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your 
loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Min-
istry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is en-
countering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make 
those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ar-
dently desires (although she should find this easier from next 
week — again, see the Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this 
— a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Um-
bridge now may be very well placed for Head Boyship in a couple 
of years! 
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the sum-
mer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no 
longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the 
dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to 
Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis 
Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently been 
sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will 
open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are 
currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have es-
caped the stigma of association with such people — the Minister 
really could not be more gracious to me — and I do hope, Ron, 
that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided 
nature of our parents’ beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope 
that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I 
shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day 
comes. 
Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly 
the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becom-
ing prefect. 
Your brother,

Harry looked up at Ron. 
“Well,” he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole 
thing a joke, “if you want to — er — what is it?” (He checked Percy’s 
letter.) “Oh yeah — ‘sever ties’ with me, I swear I won’t get violent.” 
“Give it back,” said Ron, holding out his hand. “He is —” Ron said 
jerkily, tearing Percy’s letter in half, “the world’s” — he tore it into 
quarters — “biggest” — he tore it into eighths — “git.” He threw the 
pieces into the fire. 
“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,” 
he said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra’s essay back toward 
him. 
Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face. 
“Oh, give them here,” she said abruptly. 
“What?” said Ron. 
“Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct them,” she 
said. 
“Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, you’re a lifesaver,” said Ron, 
“what can I — ?” 
“What you can say is, ‘We promise we’ll never leave our homework 
this late again,’ ” she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but 
she looked slightly amused all the same. 
“Thanks a million, Hermione,” said Harry weakly, passing over his 
essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes. 
It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but 
for the three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of 
Hermione’s quill scratching out sentences here and there on their 
essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the refer-
ence books strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. He also felt 
an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do 
with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling 
blackly in the heart of the fire. 
He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 300  
strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making 
snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about see-
ing it written down like that in Percy’s writing, about knowing that 
Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales on him to 
Umbridge, that made his situation real to him as nothing else had. He 
had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the 
summers, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup, 
had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the 
Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbal-
anced and possibly violent. 
And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought that 
Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really under-
stand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situ-
ation; nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a 
dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had 
to live with that knowledge for fourteen years. . . . 
Harry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could 
not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immedi-
ately. No . . . it could not have been. . . . He had imagined it because 
he had been thinking about Sirius. . . . 
“Okay, write that down,” Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay 
and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, “and then copy 
out this conclusion that I’ve written for you.” 
“Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever 
met,” said Ron weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again —” 
“— I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said Hermione. “Harry, 
yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have mis-
heard Professor Sinistra, Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — Harry?” 
Harry had slid off his chair onto his knees and was now crouching 
on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames. 
“Er — Harry?” said Ron uncertainly. “Why are you down there?” 
“Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire,” said Harry. 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 301  
He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius’s head in this 
very fire the previous year and talked to it too. Nevertheless, he could 
not be sure that he had really seen it this time. . . . It had vanished so 
quickly. . . . 
“Sirius’s head?” Hermione repeated. “You mean like when he 
wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he 
wouldn’t do that now, it would be too — Sirius!” 
She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the 
middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius’s head, long dark hair falling 
around his grinning face. 
“I was starting to think you’d go to bed before everyone else had 
disappeared,” he said. “I’ve been checking every hour.” 
“You’ve been popping into the fire every hour?” Harry said, half 
laughing. 
“Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet.” 
“But what if you’d been seen?” said Hermione anxiously. 
“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got 
a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” Sirius said hastily, as 
Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth. “I was gone the moment she 
looked back at me and I’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped 
log or something.” 
“But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —” Hermione began. 
“You sound like Molly,” said Sirius. “This was the only way I could 
come up with of answering Harry’s letter without resorting to a 
code — and codes are breakable.” 
At the mention of Harry’s letter, Hermione and Ron had both 
turned to stare at him. 
“You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius!” said Hermione accusingly. 
“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with 
Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind. 
“Don’t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone 
would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?” 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 302  
“No, it was very good,” said Sirius, smiling. “Anyway, we’d better 
be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar.” 
“What about — ?” Ron began, but Hermione said quickly, “We’ll 
tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.” 
“Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we don’t think it’s 
anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn’t it?” 
“Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was 
feeling a powerful emotion,” said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and 
Hermione’s winces. “So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or 
something the night I had that detention.” 
“Well, now he’s back it’s bound to hurt more often,” said Sirius. 
“So you don’t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching 
me when I was in detention with her?” Harry asked. 
“I doubt it,” said Sirius. “I know her by reputation and I’m sure 
she’s no Death Eater —” 
“She’s foul enough to be one,” said Harry darkly and Ron and 
Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement. 
“Yes, but the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters,” 
said Sirius with a wry smile. “I know she’s a nasty piece of work, 
though — you should hear Remus talk about her.” 
“Does Lupin know her?” asked Harry quickly, remembering Um-
bridge’s comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first 
lesson. 
“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation 
two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.” 
Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days 
and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further. 
“What’s she got against werewolves?” said Hermione angrily. 
“Scared of them, I expect,” said Sirius, smiling at her indignation. 
“Apparently she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have mer-
people rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your  
 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 303  
time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags 
like Kreacher on the loose —” 
Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset. 
“Sirius!” she said reproachfully. “Honestly, if you made a bit of an ef-
fort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d respond, after all, you are the only 
member of his family he’s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said —” 
“So what are Umbridge’s lessons like?” Sirius interrupted. “Is she 
training you all to kill half-breeds?” 
“No,” said Harry, ignoring Hermione’s affronted look at being cut 
off in her defense of Kreacher. “She’s not letting us use magic at all!” 
“All we do is read the stupid textbook,” said Ron. 
“Ah, well, that figures,” said Sirius. “Our information from inside 
the Ministry is that Fudge doesn’t want you trained in combat.” 
“Trained in combat?” repeated Harry incredulously. “What does he 
think we’re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?” 
“That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said Sirius, “or rather, 
that’s exactly what he’s afraid Dumbledore’s doing — forming his 
own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry 
of Magic.” 
There was a pause at this, then Ron said, “That’s the stupidest 
thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood 
comes out with.” 
“So we’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark 
Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll use spells against the Ministry?” said 
Hermione, looking furious. 
“Yep,” said Sirius. “Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing 
to seize power. He’s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the 
day. It’s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some 
trumped-up charge.” 
This reminded Harry of Percy’s letter. 
“D’you know if there’s going to be anything about Dumbledore in  
 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN 
 304  
the Daily Prophet tomorrow? Only Ron’s brother Percy reckons there 
will be —” 
“I don’t know,” said Sirius, “I haven’t seen anyone from the Order 
all weekend, they’re all busy. It’s just been Kreacher and me here. . . .” 
There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius’s voice. 
“So you haven’t had any news about Hagrid, either?” 
“Ah . . .” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back by now, no 
one’s sure what’s happened to him.” Then, seeing their stricken faces, 
he added quickly, “But Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three 
get yourselves in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine.” 
“But if he was supposed to be back by now . . .” said Hermione in 
a small, worried voice. 
“Madame Maxime was with him, we’ve been in touch with her and 
she says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s noth-
ing to suggest he’s hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly 
okay.” 
Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried 
looks. 
“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about Hagrid,” said 
Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he’s 
not back, and I know Dumbledore doesn’t want that. Hagrid’s tough, 
he’ll be okay.” And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius 
added, “When’s your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway? I was think-
ing, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn’t we? I 
thought I could —” 
“NO!” said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly. 
“Sirius, didn’t you see the Daily Prophet?” said Hermione anxiously. 
“Oh that,” said Sirius, grinning, “they’re always guessing where I 
am, they haven’t really got a clue —” 
“Yeah, but we think this time they have,” said Harry. “Something 
Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his fa-
ther was on the platform, Sirius — you know, Lucius Malfoy — so 
PERCY  AND  PADFOOT 
 305  
don’t come up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you 
again —” 
“All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius. He looked most 
displeased. “Just an idea, thought you might like to get together —” 
“I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban!” said 
Harry. 
There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a 
crease between his sunken eyes. 
“You’re less like your father than I thought,” he said finally, a defi-
nite coolness in his voice. “The risk would’ve been what made it fun 
for James.” 
“Look —” 
“Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the 
stairs,” said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying. “I’ll write to tell 
you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can 
stand to risk it?” 
There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius’s head had been 
was flickering flame once more.

hey had expected to have to comb Hermione’s Daily Prophet  
carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned 
in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared 
the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flat-
tened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Um-
bridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the 
headline: 
 
MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM 
DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER “HIGH INQUISITOR” 
 
“ ‘High Inquisitor’?” said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast 
slipping from his fingers. “What does that mean?” 
Hermione read aloud: 
“In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legis-
lation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of  
Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
“ ‘The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts 
T

 307  
for some time,’ said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. ‘He is 
now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school  
may be moving in a direction they do not approve.’ 
“This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to 
effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th 
Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of  
the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching 
post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person. 
“ ‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching 
staff at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last night. ‘Dumbledore couldn’t find any-
one, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an imme-
diate success —’ ” 
“She’s been a WHAT?” said Harry loudly. 
“Wait, there’s more,” said Hermione grimly. 
“ ‘— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of  
Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-
ground feedback about what’s really happening at Hogwarts.’ 
“It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the 
passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new posi-
tion of  ‘Hogwarts High Inquisitor.’ 
“ ‘This is an exciting new phase in the Minister’s plan to get to grips 
with what some are calling the “falling standards” at Hogwarts,’ said  
Weasley. ‘The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators 
and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has 
been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are 
delighted to say that she has accepted.’ 
“The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic support from 
parents of students at Hogwarts. 
“ ‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is 
being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 
41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. ‘Many of us with our 
children’s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of  
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 308  
Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to 
know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’ 
“Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the controversial  
staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have in-
cluded the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, 
and delusional ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody. 
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme 
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief  
Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the 
prestigious school of Hogwarts. 
“ ‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensur-
ing that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ 
said a Ministry insider last night. 
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have 
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts. 
“ ‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said  
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-
bus Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged 
links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).” 
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other 
two. 
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed 
this ‘Educational Decree’ and forced her on us! And now he’s given 
her the power to inspect other teachers!” Hermione was breathing fast 
and her eyes were very bright. “I can’t believe this. It’s outrageous. . . .” 
“I know it is,” said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, 
clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the 
words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin. 
But a grin was unfurling on Ron’s face. 
“What?” said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him. 
“Oh, I can’t wait to see McGonagall inspected,” said Ron happily. 
“Umbridge won’t know what’s hit her.” 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 309  
“Well, come on,” said Hermione, jumping up, “we’d better get go-
ing, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late. . . .” 
But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic 
lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in 
Snape’s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry’s 
moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D 
scrawled in an upper corner. 
“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you pre-
sented this work in your O.W.L,” said Snape with a smirk, as he swept 
among them, passing back their homework. “This should give you a 
realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.” 
Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them. 
“The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you 
would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a 
great deal more effort for this week’s essay on the various varieties of 
venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to 
those dunces who get D’s.” 
He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, 
“Some people got D’s? Ha!” 
Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what 
grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as 
quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information 
private. 
Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, 
Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard 
at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution 
was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione’s but it was at 
least blue rather than pink, like Neville’s, and he delivered a flask of it 
to Snape’s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defi-
ance and relief. 
“Well, that wasn’t as bad as last week, was it?” said Hermione, as 
they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 310  
the entrance hall toward lunch. “And the homework didn’t go too 
badly either, did it?” 
When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, “I mean, 
all right, I didn’t expect the top grade, not if he’s marking to O.W.L. 
standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn’t you 
say?” 
Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat. 
“Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we’ve got 
plenty of time to improve, but the grades we’re getting now are a sort 
of baseline, aren’t they? Something we can build on . . .” 
They sat down together at the Gryffindor table. 
“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O —” 
“Hermione,” said Ron sharply, “if you want to know what grades 
we got, ask.” 
“I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me —” 
“I got a P,” said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. “Happy?” 
“Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of,” said Fred, who had just ar-
rived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on 
Harry’s right. “Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.” 
“But,” said Hermione, “doesn’t P stand for . . .” 
“ ‘Poor,’ yeah,” said Lee Jordan. “Still, better than D, isn’t it? 
‘Dreadful’?” 
Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over 
his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that 
Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades. 
“So top grade’s O for ‘Outstanding,’ ” she was saying, “and then 
there’s A —” 
“No, E,” George corrected her, “E for ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ And 
I’ve always thought Fred and I should’ve got E in everything, because 
we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.” 
They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, “So after E, it’s 
A for ‘Acceptable,’ and that’s the last pass grade, isn’t it?” 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 311  
“Yep,” said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it 
to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. 
“Then you get P for ‘Poor’ ” — Ron raised both his arms in mock 
celebration — “and D for ‘Dreadful.’” 
“And then T,” George reminded him. 
“T?” asked Hermione, looking appalled. “Even lower than a D? 
What on earth does that stand for?” 
“ ‘Troll,’” said George promptly. 
Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not 
George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione 
that he had received T’s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved 
to work harder from now on. 
“You lot had an inspected lesson yet?” Fred asked them. 
“No,” said Hermione at once, “have you?” 
“Just now, before lunch,” said George. “Charms.” 
“What was it like?” Harry and Hermione asked together. 
Fred shrugged. 
“Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on 
a clipboard. You know what Flitwick’s like, he treated her like a guest, 
didn’t seem to bother him at all. She didn’t say much. Asked Alicia a 
couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia 
told her they were really good, that was it.” 
“I can’t see old Flitwick getting marked down,” said George, “he 
usually gets everyone through their exams all right.” 
“Who’ve you got this afternoon?” Fred asked Harry. 
“Trelawney —” 
“A T if ever I saw one —” 
“— and Umbridge herself.” 
“Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,” 
said George. “Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch 
practices.” 
But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 312  
to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a 
seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron el-
bowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge 
emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been 
talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level 
made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out 
Dream Oracles, look round. 
“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” said Professor Umbridge 
with her wide smile. “You received my note, I trust? Giving the time 
and date of your inspection?” 
Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, 
turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out 
books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the near-
est armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few 
inches behind Professor Trelawney’s seat. She then sat down, took her 
clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting 
for the class to begin. 
Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly 
trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnify-
ing lenses. “We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams to-
day,” she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her 
voice shook slightly. “Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each 
other’s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.” 
She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-
bridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Par-
vati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati’s 
most recent dream. 
Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge 
covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few min-
utes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney’s 
wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing ques-
tions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book.

“Think of a dream, quick,” he told Ron, “in case the old toad 
comes our way.” 
“I did it last time,” Ron protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.” 
“Oh, I dunno . . .” said Harry desperately, who could not remem-
ber dreaming anything at all over the last few days. “Let’s say I dreamed 
I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that’ll do. . . .” 
Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. 
“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the 
number of letters in the subject . . . would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘caul-
dron’ or ‘Snape’?” 
“It doesn’t matter, pick any of them,” said Harry, chancing a glance 
behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Tre-
lawney’s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher ques-
tioned Neville about his dream diary. 
“What night did you dream this again?” Ron said, immersed in 
calculations. 
“I dunno, last night, whenever you like,” Harry told him, trying to 
listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were 
only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was 
making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was 
looking extremely put out. 
“Now,” said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, “you’ve been in 
this post how long, exactly?” 
Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders 
hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible 
from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she 
seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could 
reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, “Nearly six-
teen years.” 
“Quite a period,” said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her 
clipboard. “So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?” 
“That’s right,” said Professor Trelawney shortly. 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 314  
Professor Umbridge made another note. 
“And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer 
Cassandra Trelawney?” 
“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher. 
Another note on the clipboard. 
“But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the 
first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?” 
“These things often skip — er — three generations,” said Professor 
Trelawney. 
Professor Umbridge’s toadlike smile widened. 
“Of course,” she said sweetly, making yet another note. “Well, if 
you could just predict something for me, then?” 
She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had 
stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. 
“I don’t understand you,” said Professor Trelawney, clutching con-
vulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck. 
“I’d like you to make a prediction for me,” said Professor Umbridge 
very clearly. 
Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening 
sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring 
transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full 
height, her beads and bangles clinking. 
“The Inner Eye does not See upon command!” she said in scandal-
ized tones. 
“I see,” said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on 
her clipboard. 
“I — but — but . . . wait!” said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in 
an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was 
ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. “I . . . I think 
I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense 
something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .” 
 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 315  
Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-
bridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised. 
“I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!” Professor 
Trelawney finished dramatically. 
There was a pause. Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows were still raised. 
“Right,” she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. 
“Well, if that’s really the best you can do . . .” 
She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted 
to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron’s eye and knew that 
Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew 
that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, 
they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Tre-
lawney’s side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds 
later, that was. 
“Well?” she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry’s nose, un-
characteristically brisk. “Let me see the start you’ve made on your 
dream diary, please.” 
And by the time she had interpreted Harry’s dreams at the top of 
her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, 
apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much 
less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood 
a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell 
rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for 
them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts les-
son ten minutes later. 
She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the 
room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, 
exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their 
copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask 
any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and si-
lence fell. 
 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 316  
“Wands away,” she instructed them all smilingly, and those people 
who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to 
their bags. “As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to 
turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, ‘Common De-
fensive Theories and Their Derivation.’ There will be no need to talk.” 
Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. 
The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. 
Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the 
book to keep them reading through all this year’s lessons and was on 
the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione 
had her hand in the air again. 
Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she 
seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. In-
stead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to 
her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were 
face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the 
class could not hear, “What is it this time, Miss Granger?” 
“I’ve already read chapter two,” said Hermione. 
“Well then, proceed to chapter three.” 
“I’ve read that too. I’ve read the whole book.” 
Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost 
instantly. 
“Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says 
about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.” 
“He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,” said Hermione 
promptly. “He says ‘counterjinx’ is just a name people give their jinxes 
when they want to make them sound more acceptable.” 
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was 
impressed against her will. 
“But I disagree,” Hermione continued. 
Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze be-
came distinctly colder. 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 317  
“You disagree?” 
“Yes, I do,” said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whis-
pering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted 
the rest of the class’s attention. “Mr. Slinkhard doesn’t like jinxes, does 
he? But I think they can be very useful when they’re used defensively.” 
“Oh, you do, do you?” said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to 
whisper and straightening up. “Well, I’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard’s 
opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss 
Granger.” 
“But —” Hermione began. 
“That is enough,” said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the 
front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had 
shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. “Miss Granger, I am going 
to take five points from Gryffindor House.” 
There was an outbreak of muttering at this. 
“What for?” said Harry angrily. 
“Don’t you get involved!” Hermione whispered urgently to him. 
“For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,” said Profes-
sor Umbridge smoothly. “I am here to teach you using a Ministry-
approved method that does not include inviting students to give their 
opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your pre-
vious teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but 
as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, 
who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate 
subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection —” 
“Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,” said Harry loudly, “there was 
just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out 
of the back of his head.” 
This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences 
Harry had ever heard. Then — 
“I think another week’s detentions would do you some good, Mr. 
Potter,” said Umbridge sleekly. 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 318  
 
         
The cut on the back of Harry’s hand had barely healed and by the 
following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain dur-
ing the evening’s detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge 
the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not 
a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter. 
The very worst part of this second week’s worth of detentions was, 
just as George had predicted, Angelina’s reaction. She cornered him 
just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and 
shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down 
upon the pair of them from the staff table. 
“Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! 
Five points from Gryffindor!” 
“But Professor — he’s gone and landed himself in detention 
again —” 
“What’s this, Potter?” said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding 
on Harry. “Detention? From whom?” 
“From Professor Umbridge,” muttered Harry, not meeting Profes-
sor McGonagall’s beady, square-framed eyes. 
“Are you telling me,” she said, lowering her voice so that the group 
of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, “that after the 
warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor 
Umbridge’s class again?” 
“Yes,” Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. 
“Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for seri-
ous trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!” 
“But — what? Professor, no!” Harry said, furious at this injustice. 
“I’m already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as 
well?” 
“Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you what- 
 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 319  
soever!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. “No, not another word of 
complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine 
your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing 
the team Captaincy!” 
She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look 
of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself 
onto the bench beside Ron, fuming. 
“She’s taken points off Gryffindor because I’m having my hand 
sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?” 
“I know, mate,” said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto 
Harry’s plate, “she’s bang out of order.” 
Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet 
and said nothing. 
“You think McGonagall was right, do you?” said Harry angrily to 
the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione’s face. 
“I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to 
warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,” said Hermione’s 
voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly 
giving some kind of speech. 
Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when 
they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge 
and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove 
the memory of breakfast right out of his head. 
“Excellent,” whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. 
“Let’s see Umbridge get what she deserves.” 
Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the 
slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there. 
“That will do,” she said and silence fell immediately. “Mr. Finni-
gan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, 
please take this box of mice — don’t be silly, girl, they won’t hurt 
you — and hand one to each student —” 
 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 320  
“Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly 
little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night 
of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back 
Harry’s essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his 
relief, that he had managed an A. 
“Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do 
that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you 
have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were 
left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we 
shall be —” 
“Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge. 
“Yes?” said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so 
close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. 
“I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note 
telling you of the date and time of your inspec —” 
“Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are 
doing in my classroom,” said Professor McGonagall, turning her back 
firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks 
of glee. “As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether 
more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell —” 
“Hem, hem.” 
“I wonder,” said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on 
Professor Umbridge, “how you expect to gain an idea of my usual 
teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not 
generally permit people to talk when I am talking.” 
Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in 
the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her 
clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely uncon-
cerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more. 
“As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with 
the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an inverte-
brate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 321  
offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accom-
plish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, 
let me see what you can do. . . .” 
“How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with 
Umbridge!” Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning; 
his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated. 
Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around 
the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought 
that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, 
take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor 
McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim ex-
pression on her face. 
“Well, it’s a start,” said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse 
tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around. 
As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge 
approach the teacher’s desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione 
in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. 
“How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” Professor Um-
bridge asked. 
“Thirty-nine years this December,” said Professor McGonagall 
brusquely, snapping her bag shut. 
Professor Umbridge made a note. 
“Very well,” she said, “you will receive the results of your inspection 
in ten days’ time.” 
“I can hardly wait,” said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indiffer-
ent voice, and she strode off toward the door. “Hurry up, you three,” 
she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry 
could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he re-
ceived one in return. 
He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would 
be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked 
down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 322  
found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor 
Grubbly-Plank. 
“You do not usually take this class, is that correct?” Harry heard her 
ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive 
bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living 
twigs. 
“Quite correct,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her 
back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. “I am a substitute teacher 
standing in for Professor Hagrid.” 
Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy 
was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this op-
portunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. 
“Hmm,” said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though 
Harry could still hear her quite clearly, “I wonder — the headmaster 
seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — 
can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid’s very extended leave 
of absence?” 
Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. 
“ ’Fraid I can’t,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. “Don’t 
know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumble-
dore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that’s 
as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?” 
“Yes, please do,” said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her 
clipboard. 
Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among 
the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people 
were able to answer well and Harry’s spirits lifted somewhat; at least 
the class was not letting Hagrid down. 
“Overall,” said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-
Plank’s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, “how do 
you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose  
 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 323  
you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive 
enough support from the school management?” 
“Oh, yes, Dumbledore’s excellent,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank 
heartily. “No, I’m very happy with the way things are run, very happy 
indeed.” 
Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her 
clipboard and went on, “And what are you planning to cover with this 
class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not 
return?” 
“Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that most often come up 
in O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Not much left to do — 
they’ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and 
kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .” 
“Well, you seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said Pro-
fessor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry 
did not like the emphasis she put on “you” and liked it even less when 
she put her next question to Goyle: “Now, I hear there have been in-
juries in this class?” 
Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question. 
“That was me,” he said. “I was slashed by a hippogriff.” 
“A hippogriff?” said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically. 
“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him 
to do,” said Harry angrily. 
Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her 
head slowly in Harry’s direction. 
“Another night’s detention, I think,” she said softly. “Well, thank 
you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that’s all I need 
here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten 
days.” 
“Jolly good,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-
bridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. 
 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 324  
 
         
It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge’s office that night, 
his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had 
wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when 
he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He 
was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be 
sympathetic rather than critical. 
“Here,” she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid 
toward him, “soak your hand in that, it’s a solution of strained and 
pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.” 
Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experi-
enced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his 
legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. 
“Thanks,” he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks’s ears 
with his left hand. 
“I still reckon you should complain about this,” said Ron in a low 
voice. 
“No,” said Harry flatly. 
“McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —” 
“Yeah, she probably would,” said Harry. “And how long d’you 
reckon it’d take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who 
complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?” 
Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a 
moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way. 
“She’s an awful woman,” said Hermione in a small voice. “Awful. 
You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we’ve got to 
do something about her.” 
“I suggested poison,” said Ron grimly. 
“No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, 
and how we’re not going to learn any defense from her at all,” said 
Hermione. 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 325  
“Well, what can we do about that?” said Ron, yawning. “ ’S too late, 
isn’t it? She got the job, she’s here to stay, Fudge’ll make sure of that.” 
“Well,” said Hermione tentatively. “You know, I was thinking to-
day. . . .” She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, 
“I was thinking that — maybe the time’s come when we should just — 
just do it ourselves.” 
“Do what ourselves?” said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand 
in the essence of murtlap tentacles. 
“Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,” said Her-
mione. 
“Come off it,” groaned Ron. “You want us to do extra work? D’you 
realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it’s only the 
second week?” 
“But this is much more important than homework!” said Hermione. 
Harry and Ron goggled at her. 
“I didn’t think there was anything in the universe more important 
than homework,” said Ron. 
“Don’t be silly, of course there is!” said Hermione, and Harry saw, 
with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the 
kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. “It’s about prepar-
ing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge’s first lesson, for what’s 
waiting out there. It’s about making sure we really can defend our-
selves. If we don’t learn anything for a whole year —” 
“We can’t do much by ourselves,” said Ron in a defeated voice. “I 
mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and 
practice them, I suppose —” 
“No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn 
things out of books,” said Hermione. “We need a teacher, a proper 
one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re go-
ing wrong.” 
“If you’re talking about Lupin . . .” Harry began. 
“No, no, I’m not talking about Lupin,” said Hermione. “He’s too 
CHAPTER  FIFTEEN 
 326  
busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during 
Hogsmeade weekends and that’s not nearly often enough.” 
“Who, then?” said Harry, frowning at her. 
Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. 
“Isn’t it obvious?” she said. “I’m talking about you, Harry.” 
There was a moment’s silence. A light night breeze rattled the win-
dowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered. 
“About me what?” said Harry. 
“I’m talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.” 
Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the 
exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated 
on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry’s consternation, how-
ever, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, appar-
ently thinking. Then he said, “That’s an idea.” 
“What’s an idea?” said Harry. 
“You,” said Ron. “Teaching us to do it.” 
“But . . .” 
Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg. 
“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t —” 
“Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark 
Arts,” said Hermione. 
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m 
not, you’ve beaten me in every test —” 
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our 
third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who 
actually knew the subject. But I’m not talking about test results, 
Harry. Look what you’ve done!” 
“How d’you mean?” 
“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching 
me,” Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. 
“Let’s think,” he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . . 
first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.” 
THE  HOGWARTS 
HIGH  INQUISITOR 
 327  
“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill —” 
“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and de-
stroyed Riddle.” 
“Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I —” 
“Third year,” said Ron, louder still, “you fought off about a hun-
dred dementors at once —” 
“You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t —” 
“Last year,” Ron said, almost shouting now, “you fought off You-
Know-Who again —” 
“Listen to me!” said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and 
Hermione were both smirking now. “Just listen to me, all right? It 
sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I 
didn’t know what I was doing half the time, I didn’t plan any of it, I 
just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —” 
Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper 
rise; he wasn’t even sure why he was feeling so angry. 
“Don’t sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was 
there, wasn’t I?” he said heatedly. “I know what went on, all right? And 
I didn’t get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense 
Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help 
came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blun-
dered through it all, I didn’t have a clue what I was doing — STOP 
LAUGHING!” 
The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He be-
came aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn’t remember 
standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and 
Hermione’s smiles had vanished. 
“You don’t know what it’s like! You — neither of you — you’ve never 
had to face him, have you? You think it’s just memorizing a bunch of

think straight when you know you’re about a second from being mur-
dered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they’ve never 
taught us that in their classes, what it’s like to deal with things like 
that — and you two sit there acting like I’m a clever little boy to be 
standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — 
you just don’t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would 
have been if Voldemort hadn’t needed me —” 
“We weren’t saying anything like that, mate,” said Ron, looking 
aghast. “We weren’t having a go at Diggory, we didn’t — you’ve got 
the wrong end of the —” 
He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. 
“Harry,” she said timidly, “don’t you see? This . . . this is exactly 
why we need you. . . . We need to know what it’s r-really like . . . fac-
ing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.” 
It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort’s name, and it was 
this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, 
he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand 
was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the 
bowl of murtlap essence. 
“Well . . . think about it,” said Hermione quietly. “Please?” 
Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed 
of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was 
agreeing to. 
Hermione stood up. 
“Well, I’m off to bed,” she said in a voice that was clearly as natural 
as she could make it. “Erm . . . ’night.” 
Ron had gotten to his feet too. 
“Coming?” he said awkwardly to Harry. 
“Yeah,” said Harry. “In . . . in a minute. I’ll just clear this up.” 
He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left. 
“Reparo,” Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces

 of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no re-
turning the murtlap essence to the bowl. 
He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his 
armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed 
Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams 
of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his 
scar prickling again.

ermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against 
the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original 
suggestion. Harry’s detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he 
doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand 
would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices 
and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had 
managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actu-
ally progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached 
again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the 
three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients 
for Snape. 
“I was wondering,” Hermione said suddenly, “whether you’d 
thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry.” 
“ ’Course I have,” said Harry grumpily. “Can’t forget it, can we, 
with that hag teaching us —” 
“I meant the idea Ron and I had” — Ron cast her an alarmed, 
threatening kind of look; she frowned at him — “oh, all right, the 
idea I  had, then — about you teaching us.”

Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page 
of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his 
mind. 
The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought 
over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it 
had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had 
found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his 
various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters — found 
himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons. . . . 
“Well,” he said slowly, when he could not pretend to find Asiatic 
anti-venoms interesting much longer, “yeah, I — I’ve thought about 
it a bit.” 
“And?” said Hermione eagerly. 
“I dunno,” said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron. 
“I thought it was a good idea from the start,” said Ron, who 
seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that 
Harry was not going to start shouting again. 
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. 
“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn’t 
you?” 
“Yes, Harry,” said Hermione gently, “but all the same, there’s no 
point pretending that you’re not good at Defense Against the Dark 
Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could 
throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, 
you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can’t, Viktor al-
ways said —” 
Ron looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck; rub-
bing it, he said, “Yeah? What did Vicky say?” 
“Ho ho,” said Hermione in a bored voice. “He said Harry knew 
how to do stuff even he didn’t, and he was in the final year at 
Durmstrang.” 
Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously. 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 332  
“You’re not still in contact with him, are you?” 
“So what if I am?” said Hermione coolly, though her face was a lit-
tle pink. “I can have a pen pal if I —” 
“He didn’t only want to be your pen pal,” said Ron accusingly. 
Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who 
was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, “Well, what do you think? 
Will you teach us?” 
“Just you and Ron, yeah?” 
“Well,” said Hermione, now looking a mite anxious again. “Well 
. . . now, don’t fly off the handle again, Harry, please. . . . But I really 
think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we’re 
talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort — oh, don’t 
be pathetic, Ron — it doesn’t seem fair if we don’t offer the chance to 
other people.” 
Harry considered this for a moment, then said, “Yeah, but I doubt 
anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I’m a nutter, 
remember?” 
“Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be 
interested in hearing what you’ve got to say,” said Hermione seriously. 
“Look,” she leaned toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with 
a frown on his face, leaned forward to listen too, “you know the first 
weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we 
tell anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk 
it over?” 
“Why do we have to do it outside school?” said Ron. 
“Because,” said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese 
Chomping Cabbage she was copying, “I don’t think Umbridge would 
be very happy if she found out what we were up to.” 
 
Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogs-
meade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained 
a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 333  
September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they 
did not want him to come — but he still worried from time to time 
that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. 
What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up 
the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of 
Draco Malfoy? 
“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about,” said 
Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. “I 
mean, he’s been on the run for over two years, hasn’t he, and I know 
that can’t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn’t he? And 
now he’s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.” 
Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on 
Kreacher. 
“The trouble is,” she said to Harry, “until V-Voldemort — oh for 
heaven’s sake, Ron — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have 
to stay hidden, isn’t he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn’t going to re-
alize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore’s been 
telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catch-
ing real Death Eaters again it’ll be obvious Sirius isn’t one . . . I mean, 
he hasn’t got the Mark, for one thing.” 
“I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,” said Ron brac-
ingly. “Dumbledore’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumble-
dore even if he doesn’t like what he hears.” 
When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, “Listen, 
Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might 
want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there 
are a couple who seem interested. We’ve told them to meet us in 
Hogsmeade.” 
“Right,” said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius. 
“Don’t worry, Harry,” Hermione said quietly. “You’ve got enough 
on your plate without Sirius too.” 
She was quite right, of course; he was barely keeping up with his 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 334  
homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no 
longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was 
even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they 
both had Quidditch practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect du-
ties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of 
them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding 
time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting 
better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the 
hats and the socks. 
The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Af-
ter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their 
names to the long list of students who had permission from their par-
ents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry re-
membered that if it hadn’t been for Sirius, he would not have been 
going at all. 
When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as 
though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he 
gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, 
out onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day. 
“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked Ron, as he, Harry, and 
Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates. 
“I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,” said 
Harry with a small laugh. “I forgot to tell you . . .” 
And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch 
bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight sur-
prise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, in-
deed, than he did himself. 
“He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But 
who had tipped him off?” 
“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging. “Maybe Malfoy, he’d think it was 
a laugh.” 
They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 335  
boars and turned left onto the road into the village, the wind whip-
ping their hair into their eyes. 
“Malfoy?” said Hermione, very skeptically. “Well . . . yes . . . 
maybe . . .” 
And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of 
Hogsmeade. 
“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked. “The Three Broom-
sticks?” 
“Oh — no,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “no, it’s al-
ways packed and really noisy. I’ve told the others to meet us in the 
Hog’s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it’s not on the main 
road. I think it’s a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don’t 
normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be overheard.” 
They walked down the main street past Zonko’s Joke Shop, where 
they were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the 
post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up 
a side street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden 
sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of 
a wild boar’s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around 
it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them 
hesitated outside the door. 
“Well, come on,” said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the 
way inside. 
It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an 
impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog’s Head bar 
comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly 
of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so 
encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the 
room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough 
wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as 
Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what 
seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries. 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 336  
Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: 
“Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,” he had said, explaining 
how he had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there. At the 
time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the 
stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw 
that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s 
Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in 
dirty gray bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless 
glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth. 
Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; 
Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talk-
ing in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace 
sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just 
see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly. 
“I don’t know about this, Hermione,” Harry muttered, as they 
crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled 
witch. “Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?” 
Hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure. 
“Umbridge is shorter than that woman,” she said quietly. “And 
anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there’s nothing she can 
do to stop us, Harry, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the 
school rules. We’re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor 
Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog’s Head, 
and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. 
And I’ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and 
homework groups and they’re definitely allowed. I just don’t think it’s 
a good idea if we parade what we’re doing.” 
“No,” said Harry dryly, “especially as it’s not exactly a homework 
group you’re planning, is it?” 
The barman sidled toward them out of a back room. He was a 
grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and 
beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry. 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 337  
“What?” he grunted. 
“Three butterbeers, please,” said Hermione. 
The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very 
dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar. 
“Six Sickles,” he said. 
“I’ll get them,” said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The bar-
man’s eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his 
scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry’s money in an ancient 
wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and 
sat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages 
rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking 
drink from the barman. 
“You know what?” Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with 
enthusiasm. “We could order anything we liked in here, I bet that 
bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn’t care. I’ve always wanted to 
try firewhisky —” 
“You — are — a — prefect,” snarled Hermione. 
“Oh,” said Ron, the smile fading from his face. “Yeah . . .” 
“So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” Harry asked, 
wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig. 
“Just a couple of people,” Hermione repeated, checking her watch 
and then looking anxiously toward the door. “I told them to be here 
about now and I’m sure they all know where it is — oh look, this 
might be them now —” 
The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight 
split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the 
incoming rush of a crowd of people. 
First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely fol-
lowed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry’s stomach did a back 
flip) Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own 
and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident) 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 338  
Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina John-
son, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-
Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait 
down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw 
boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Cor-
ner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with 
an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member 
of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and 
George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were 
carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko’s merchandise. 
“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. “A couple 
of people?” 
“Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” said Hermione happily. 
“Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?” 
The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag 
so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly he had 
never seen his pub so full. 
“Hi,” said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions 
quickly. “Could we have . . . twenty-five butterbeers, please?” 
The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down 
his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very 
important, he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the 
bar. 
“Cheers,” said Fred, handing them out. “Cough up, everyone, I 
haven’t got enough gold for all of these. . . .” 
Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their 
beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could 
not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible 
thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of 
speech, at which he rounded on Hermione. 
“What have you been telling people?” he said in a low voice. “What 
are they expecting?” 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 339  
“I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say,” said 
Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously 
that she added quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak 
to them first.” 
“Hi, Harry,” said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite 
Harry. 
Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was excep-
tionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron’s right. 
Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but 
gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that, 
given her way, she would not be here at all. 
In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Love-
good gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a 
chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry. 
“Er,” said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of 
nerves. “Well — er — hi.” 
The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes con-
tinued to dart back regularly to Harry. 
“Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you’re here. Erm . . . well, 
Harry here had the idea — I mean” — Harry had thrown her a sharp 
look — “I had the idea — that it might be good if people who 
wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really 
study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with 
us” — (Hermione’s voice became suddenly much stronger and more 
confident) — “because nobody could call that Defense Against the 
Dark Arts” — “Hear, hear,” said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione 
looked heartened — “well, I thought it would be good if we, well, 
took matters into our own hands.” 
She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, “And by that I 
mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but 
the real spells —” 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 340  
“You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too 
though, I bet?” said Michael Corner. 
“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want more than 
that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because . . . because . . .” 
She took a great breath and finished, “Because Lord Voldemort’s 
back.” 
The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho’s friend shrieked 
and slopped butterbeer down herself, Terry Boot gave a kind of invol-
untary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp 
that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked 
fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry. 
“Well . . . that’s the plan anyway,” said Hermione. “If you want to 
join us, we need to decide how we’re going to —” 
“Where’s the proof You-Know-Who’s back?” said the blond Huffle-
puff player in a rather aggressive voice. 
“Well, Dumbledore believes it —” Hermione began. 
“You mean, Dumbledore believes him,” said the blond boy, nod-
ding at Harry. 
“Who are you?” said Ron rather rudely. 
“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve got the right to 
know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who’s back.” 
“Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what 
this meeting was supposed to be about —” 
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry. 
It had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there. 
He felt that Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these 
people — maybe even most of them — had turned up in the hope of 
hearing Harry’s story firsthand. 
“What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back?” he asked, looking 
Zacharias straight in the face. “I saw him. But Dumbledore told the 
whole school what happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him,  
 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 341  
you don’t believe me, and I’m not wasting an afternoon trying to con-
vince anyone.” 
The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. 
Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in. He 
was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag; it was becoming steadily 
dirtier. 
Zacharias said dismissively, “All Dumbledore told us last year was 
that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you 
brought Diggory’s body back to Hogwarts. He didn’t give us details, 
he didn’t tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we’d all 
like to know —” 
“If you’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort 
murders someone I can’t help you,” Harry said. His temper, always so 
close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his 
eyes from Zacharias Smith’s aggressive face, determined not to look at 
Cho. “I don’t want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that’s 
what you’re here for, you might as well clear out.” 
He cast an angry look in Hermione’s direction. This was, he felt, all 
her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of 
course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. . . . 
But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he 
continued to gaze intently at Harry. 
“So,” said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. “So . . . 
like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need 
to work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet, 
and where we’re going to —” 
“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, 
looking at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?” 
There was a murmur of interest around the group at this. 
“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively. 
“A corporeal Patronus?” 
 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 342  
The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory. 
“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked. 
The girl smiled. 
“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about 
your hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. 
“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I never knew 
that!” 
“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at 
Harry. “She said you got enough attention as it was.” 
“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people 
laughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat. 
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s of-
fice?” demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the 
wall told me when I was in there last year. . . .” 
“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry. 
Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers exchanged 
awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said “wow” softly. Harry was 
feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly look-
ing anywhere but at Cho. 
“And in our first year,” said Neville to the group at large, “he saved 
that Sorcerous Stone —” 
“Sorcerer’s,” hissed Hermione. 
“Yes, that, from You-Know-Who,” finished Neville. 
Hannah Abbott’s eyes were as round as Galleons. 
“And that’s not to mention,” said Cho (Harry’s eyes snapped onto 
her, she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somer-
sault), “all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament 
last year — getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and 
things. . . .” 
There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. 
 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 343  
Harry’s insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so 
that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had 
just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing 
he had sworn to himself he would tell them. 
“Look,” he said and everyone fell silent at once, “I . . . I don’t want 
to sound like I’m trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot 
of help with all that stuff. . . .” 
“Not with the dragon, you didn’t,” said Michael Corner at once. 
“That was a seriously cool bit of flying. . . .” 
“Yeah, well —” said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree. 
“And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,” 
said Susan Bones. 
“No,” said Harry, “no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, 
but the point I’m trying to make is —” 
“Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?” said 
Zacharias Smith. 
“Here’s an idea,” said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, “why 
don’t you shut your mouth?” 
Perhaps the word “weasel” had affected Ron particularly strongly; 
in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like 
nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed. 
“Well, we’ve all turned up to learn from him, and now he’s telling 
us he can’t really do any of it,” he said. 
“That’s not what he said,” snarled Fred Weasley. 
“Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?” inquired 
George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from in-
side one of the Zonko’s bags. 
“Or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy where we stick 
this,” said Fred. 
“Yes, well,” said Hermione hastily, “moving on . . . the point is, are 
we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?”

There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his 
arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too 
busy keeping an eye on the instrument in George’s hand. 
“Right,” said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at 
last been settled. “Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. 
I really don’t think there’s any point in meeting less than once a 
week —” 
“Hang on,” said Angelina, “we need to make sure this doesn’t clash 
with our Quidditch practice.” 
“No,” said Cho, “nor with ours.” 
“Nor ours,” added Zacharias Smith. 
“I’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,” said Hermione, 
slightly impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re 
talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s 
Death Eaters —” 
“Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been ex-
pecting to speak long before this. “Personally I think this is really im-
portant, possibly more important than anything else we’ll do this year, 
even with our O.W.L.s coming up!” 
He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry, 
“Surely not!” When nobody spoke, he went on, “I, personally, am at a 
loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us 
at this critical period. Obviously they are in denial about the return of 
You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively pre-
vent us from using defensive spells —” 
“We think the reason Umbridge doesn’t want us trained in Defense 
Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione, “is that she’s got some . . . 
some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school 
as a kind of private army. She thinks he’d mobilize us against the 
Ministry.” 
Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except

Luna Lovegood, who piped up, “Well, that makes sense. After all, 
Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army.” 
“What?” said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece 
of information. 
“Yes, he’s got an army of heliopaths,” said Luna solemnly. 
“No, he hasn’t,” snapped Hermione. 
“Yes, he has,” said Luna. 
“What are heliopaths?” asked Neville, looking blank. 
“They’re spirits of fire,” said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening 
so that she looked madder than ever. “Great tall flaming creatures that 
gallop across the ground burning everything in front of —” 
“They don’t exist, Neville,” said Hermione tartly. 
“Oh yes they do!” said Luna angrily. 
“I’m sorry, but where’s the proof  of that?” snapped Hermione. 
“There are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you’re so 
narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose 
before you —” 
“Hem, hem,” said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Um-
bridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. 
“Weren’t we trying to decide how often we’re going to meet and get 
Defense lessons?” 
“Yes,” said Hermione at once, “yes, we were, you’re right. . . .” 
“Well, once a week sounds cool,” said Lee Jordan. 
“As long as —” began Angelina. 
“Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,” said Hermione in a tense 
voice. “Well, the other thing to decide is where we’re going to 
meet. . . .” 
This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent. 
“Library?” suggested Katie Bell after a few moments. 
“I can’t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in 
the library,” said Harry. 
 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 346  
“Maybe an unused classroom?” said Dean. 
“Yeah,” said Ron, “McGonagall might let us have hers, she did 
when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard. . . .” 
But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so ac-
commodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study 
and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this 
one might be considered a lot more rebellious. 
“Right, well, we’ll try to find somewhere,” said Hermione. “We’ll 
send a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and a place 
for the first meeting.” 
She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, 
then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say 
something. 
“I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we 
know who was here. But I also think,” she took a deep breath, “that 
we all ought to agree not to shout about what we’re doing. So if you 
sign, you’re agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what 
we’re up to.” 
Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his 
signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less 
than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list. 
“Er . . .” said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that 
George was trying to pass him. “Well . . . I’m sure Ernie will tell me 
when the meeting is.” 
But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too. Hermione 
raised her eyebrows at him. 
“I — well, we are prefects,” Ernie burst out. “And if this list was 
found . . . well, I mean to say . . . you said yourself, if Umbridge finds 
out . . .” 
“You just said this group was the most important thing you’d do 
this year,” Harry reminded him. 
“I — yes,” said Ernie, “yes, I do believe that, it’s just . . .” 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 347  
“Ernie, do you really think I’d leave that list lying around?” said 
Hermione testily. 
“No. No, of course not,” said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. 
“I — yes, of course I’ll sign.” 
Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho’s 
friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name. 
When the last person — Zacharias — had signed, Hermione took 
the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an 
odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed 
some kind of contract. 
“Well, time’s ticking on,” said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. 
“George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, 
we’ll be seeing you all later.” 
In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too. Cho 
made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leav-
ing, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face, 
but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so 
that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered 
her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry. 
“Well, I think that went quite well,” said Hermione happily, as she, 
Harry, and Ron walked out of the Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight 
a few moments later, Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of 
butterbeer. 
“That Zacharias bloke’s a wart,” said Ron, who was glowering after 
the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance. 
“I don’t like him much either,” admitted Hermione, “but he over-
heard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he 
seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more 
people the better really — I mean, Michael Corner and his friends 
wouldn’t have come if he hadn’t been going out with Ginny —” 
Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer 
bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front. 
CHAPTER  SIXTEEN 
 348  
“He’s WHAT?” said Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls 
of raw beef. “She’s going out with — my sister’s going — what d’you 
mean, Michael Corner?” 
“Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think — well, they’re 
obviously interested in learning defense, but if Ginny hadn’t told 
Michael what was going on —” 
“When did this — when did she — ?” 
“They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last 
year,” said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High 
Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop, where there 
was a handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the window. 
“Hmm . . . I could do with a new quill.” 
She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her. 
“Which one was Michael Corner?” Ron demanded furiously. 
“The dark one,” said Hermione. 
“I didn’t like him,” said Ron at once. 
“Big surprise,” said Hermione under her breath. 
“But,” said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in cop-
per pots, “I thought Ginny fancied Harry!” 
Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head. 
“Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. 
Not that she doesn’t like you, of course,” she added kindly to Harry 
while she examined a long black-and-gold quill. 
Harry, whose head was still full of Cho’s parting wave, did not find 
this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering 
with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until 
now he had not really registered. 
“So that’s why she talks now?” he asked Hermione. “She never used 
to talk in front of me.” 
“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Yes, I think I’ll have this one. . . .” 
She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two 
Knuts, Ron still breathing down her neck. 
IN  THE  HOG’S  HEAD 
 349  
“Ron,” she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, “this is 
exactly why Ginny hasn’t told you she’s seeing Michael, she knew 
you’d take it badly. So don’t harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.” 
“What d’you mean, who’s taking anything badly? I’m not going to 
harp on about anything . . .” 
Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the 
street. Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an under-
tone, while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, 
“And talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and 
you?” 
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. 
It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a 
burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold — 
had he been that obvious? 
“Well,” said Hermione, smiling slightly, “she just couldn’t keep her 
eyes off you, could she?” 
Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of 
Hogsmeade was.

arry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done 
all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up 
with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be 
called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than 
sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work 
outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of 
the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, 
brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting nee-
dles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing 
more hats and scarves. 
The knowledge that they were doing something to resist Umbridge 
and the Ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave 
Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. He kept reliving Saturday’s 
meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defense 
Against the Dark Arts . . . and the looks on their faces as they had 
heard some of the things he had done . . . and Cho praising his per-
formance in the Triwizard Tournament. . . . The knowledge that all 
 
H 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE 
NUMBER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 351  
 those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be ad-
mired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday 
morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes. 
He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together, dis-
cussing Angelina’s idea that they were to work on a new move called 
the Sloth Grip Roll during that night’s Quidditch practice, and not 
until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they no-
tice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention 
of a small group of people. 
A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice board, so 
large that it covered everything else on there — the lists of second-
hand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from 
Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to barter 
certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the Weasleys’ new advertise-
ment for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-
and-found notices. The new sign was printed in large black letters and 
there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat 
 and curly signature.

Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-
looking second years. 
“Does this mean they’re going to shut down the Gobstones Club?” 
one of them asked his friend. 
“I reckon you’ll be okay with Gobstones,” Ron said darkly, making 
the second year jump. “I don’t think we’re going to be as lucky, 
though, do you?” he asked Harry as the second years hurried away. 
Harry was reading the notice through again. The happiness that 
had filled him since Saturday was gone. His insides were pulsing with 
rage. 
“This isn’t a coincidence,” he said, his hands forming fists. “She 
knows.” 
“She can’t,” said Ron at once. 
“There were people listening in that pub. And let’s face it, we don’t 
know how many of the people who turned up we can trust. . . . Any 
of them could have run off and told Umbridge. . . .” 
And he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired 
him . . . 
“Zacharias Smith!” said Ron at once, punching a fist into his hand. 
“Or — I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too —” 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE 
NUMBER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 353  
“I wonder if Hermione’s seen this yet?” Harry said, looking around 
at the door to the girls’ dormitories. 
“Let’s go and tell her,” said Ron. He bounded forward, pulled open 
the door, and set off up the spiral staircase. 
He was on the sixth stair when it happened. There was a loud, wail-
ing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long, 
smooth stone slide. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep 
running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over 
backward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on 
his back at Harry’s feet. 
“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,” said 
Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh. 
Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide. 
“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” they giggled happily, leaping to 
their feet and ogling Harry and Ron. 
“Me,” said Ron, who was still rather disheveled. “I didn’t realize 
that would happen. It’s not fair!” he added to Harry, as the girls 
headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. “Hermione’s al-
lowed in our dormitory, how come we’re not allowed — ?” 
“Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,” said Hermione, who had just slid 
neatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, 
“but it says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys 
were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get 
in there?” 
“To see you — look at this!” said Ron, dragging her over to the no-
tice board. 
Hermione’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her expression be-
came stony. 
“Someone must have blabbed to her!” Ron said angrily. 
“They can’t have done,” said Hermione in a low voice. 
“You’re so naive,” said Ron, “you think just because you’re all hon-
orable and trustworthy —” 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 354  
“No, they can’t have done because I put a jinx on that piece of 
parchment we all signed,” said Hermione grimly. “Believe me, if any-
one’s run off and told Umbridge, we’ll know exactly who they are and 
they will really regret it.” 
“What’ll happen to them?” said Ron eagerly. 
“Well, put it this way,” said Hermione, “it’ll make Eloise Midgen’s 
acne look like a couple of cute freckles. Come on, let’s get down to 
breakfast and see what the others think. . . . I wonder whether this has 
been put up in all the Houses?” 
It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Um-
bridge’s sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower. There was a 
peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of move-
ment in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables confer-
ring on what they had read. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had barely 
taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George, and Ginny de-
scended upon them. 
“Did you see it?” 
“D’you reckon she knows?” 
“What are we going to do?” 
They were all looking at Harry. He glanced around to make sure 
there were no teachers near them. 
“We’re going to do it anyway, of course,” he said quietly. 
“Knew you’d say that,” said George, beaming and thumping Harry 
on the arm. 
“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and 
Hermione. 
“Of course,” said Hermione coolly. 
“Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron, looking over 
his shoulder. “And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith . . . and no one 
looks very spotty.” 
Hermione looked alarmed. 
“Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE 
NUMBER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 355  
really suspicious — sit down!” she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, 
gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. “Later! 
We’ll — talk — to — you — later!” 
“I’ll tell Michael,” said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her 
bench. “The fool, honestly . . .” 
She hurried off toward the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go. 
Cho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she 
had brought along to the Hog’s Head. Would Umbridge’s notice scare 
her off meeting them again? 
But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were 
leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic. 
“Harry! Ron!” 
It was Angelina and she was hurrying toward them looking per-
fectly desperate. 
“It’s okay,” said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear 
him. “We’re still going to —” 
“You realize she’s including Quidditch in this?” Angelina said over 
him. “We have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor 
team!” 
“What?” said Harry. 
“No way,” said Ron, appalled. 
“You read the sign, it mentions teams too! So listen, Harry . . . I am 
saying this for the last time. . . . Please, please don’t lose your temper 
with Umbridge again or she might not let us play anymore!” 
“Okay, okay,” said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on 
the verge of tears. “Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself. . . .” 
“Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,” said Ron grimly, as they set 
off for Binns’s lesson. “She hasn’t inspected Binns yet. . . . Bet you 
anything she’s there. . . .” 
But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was 
Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and 
preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 356  
did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled 
idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione’s frequent glares and 
nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up 
angrily. 
“What?” 
She pointed at the window. Harry looked around. Hedwig was 
perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass 
at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had 
just had breakfast, why on earth hadn’t she delivered the letter then, as 
usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other 
too. 
“Oh, I’ve always loved that owl, she’s so beautiful,” Harry heard 
Lavender sigh to Parvati. 
He glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read his 
notes, serenely unaware that the class’s attention was even less focused 
upon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched 
down, and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the 
catch and opened it very slowly. 
He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could re-
move the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the 
window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. 
He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, 
crouched low again, and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his 
shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap, and 
made to remove the letter tied to her leg. 
It was only then that he realized that Hedwig’s feathers were oddly 
ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of 
her wings at an odd angle. 
“She’s hurt!” Harry whispered, bending his head low over her. 
Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her 
quill. “Look — there’s something wrong with her wing —” 
Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE 
NUMBER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 357  
gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating 
herself, and gazed at him reproachfully. 
“Professor Binns,” said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class 
turned to look at him. “I’m not feeling well.” 
Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as 
always, to find the room in front of him full of people. 
“Not feeling well?” he repeated hazily. 
“Not at all well,” said Harry firmly, getting to his feet while con-
cealing Hedwig behind his back. “So I think I’ll need to go to the hos-
pital wing.” 
“Yes,” said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. “Yes 
. . . yes, hospital wing . . . well, off you go, then, Perkins . . .” 
Once outside the room Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and 
hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of 
sight of Binns’s door. His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig 
would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where 
Hagrid was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-
Plank and hope she would help. 
He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There 
was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid’s cabin; if she was not teach-
ing, she was probably in the staffroom. He set off downstairs, Hedwig 
hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder. 
Two stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door. As Harry ap-
proached, one of them croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.” 
“This is urgent,” said Harry curtly. 
“Ooooh, urgent, is it?” said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched 
voice. “Well, that’s put us in our place, hasn’t it?” 
Harry knocked; he heard footsteps and then the door opened and 
he found himself face-to-face with Professor McGonagall. 
“You haven’t been given another detention!” she said at once, her 
square spectacles flashing alarmingly. 
“No, Professor!” said Harry hastily. 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 358  
“Well then, why are you out of class?” 
“It’s urgent, apparently,” said the second gargoyle snidely. 
“I’m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,” Harry explained. “It’s 
my owl, she’s injured.” 
“Injured owl, did you say?” 
Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall’s 
shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet. 
“Yes,” said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, “she 
turned up after the other post owls and her wing’s all funny, look —” 
Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth 
and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched. 
“Hmm,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly 
as she talked. “Looks like something’s attacked her. Can’t think what 
would have done it, though. . . . Thestrals will sometimes go for 
birds, of course, but Hagrid’s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained 
not to touch owls . . .” 
Harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted 
to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, 
however, looked sharply at Harry and said, “Do you know how far 
this owl’s traveled, Potter?” 
“Er,” said Harry. “From London, I think.” 
He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood “London” to 
mean “number twelve, Grimmauld Place” by the way her eyebrows 
had joined in the middle. 
Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her 
robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig’s wing closely. “I 
should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,” she 
said. “She shouldn’t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.” 
“Er — right — thanks,” said Harry, just as the bell rang for break. 
“No problem,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back 
into the staffroom. 
 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE 
NUMBER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 359  
“Just a moment, Wilhelmina!” said Professor McGonagall. “Pot-
ter’s letter!” 
“Oh yeah!” said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll 
tied to Hedwig’s leg. Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then 
disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at 
Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this. 
Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall 
called him back. 
“Potter!” 
“Yes, Professor?” 
She glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming 
from both directions. 
“Bear in mind,” she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll 
in his hand, “that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts 
may be being watched, won’t you?” 
“I —” said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corri-
dor was almost upon him. Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod 
and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into 
the courtyard with the crowd. Here he spotted Ron and Hermione al-
ready standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up 
against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them 
and found five words in Sirius’s handwriting: 
Today, same time, same place. 
“Is Hedwig okay?” asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was 
within earshot. 
“Where did you take her?” asked Ron. 
“To Grubbly-Plank,” said Harry. “And I met McGonagall. . . . 
Listen. . . .” 
And he told them what Professor McGonagall had said. To his  
 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 360  
surprise, neither of the others looked shocked; on the contrary, they 
exchanged significant looks. 
“What?” said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back 
again. 
“Well, I was just saying to Ron . . . what if someone had tried to in-
tercept Hedwig? I mean, she’s never been hurt on a flight before, has 
she?” 
“Who’s the letter from anyway?” asked Ron, taking the note from 
Harry. 
“Snuffles,” said Harry quietly. 
“ ‘Same time, same place’? Does he mean the fire in the common 
room?” 
“Obviously,” said Hermione, also reading the note. She looked un-
easy. “I just hope nobody else has read this. . . .” 
“But it was still sealed and everything,” said Harry, trying to con-
vince himself as much as her. “And nobody would understand what it 
meant if they didn’t know where we’d spoken to him before, would 
they?” 
“I don’t know,” said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back 
over her shoulder as the bell rang again. “It wouldn’t be exactly diffi-
cult to reseal the scroll by magic. . . . And if anyone’s watching the 
Floo Network . . . but I don’t really see how we can warn him not to 
come without that being intercepted too!” 
They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all 
three of them lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the 
stairs they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, 
who was standing just outside Snape’s classroom door, waving around 
an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than 
was necessary so that they could hear every word. 
“Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to 
continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morn-
ing. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father

really well, he’s always popping in and out of the Ministry. . . . It’ll be 
interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, 
wont it?” 
“Don’t rise,” Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, 
who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. “It’s 
what he wants. . . .” 
“I mean,” said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his gray eyes 
glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron’s direction, “if it’s a question 
of influence with the Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance. 
. . . From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to 
sack Arthur Weasley for years. . . . And as for Potter . . . My father 
says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. 
Mungo’s. . . . apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose 
brains have been addled by magic. . . .” 
Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes 
rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter, Pansy 
Parkinson shrieked with glee. 
Something collided hard with Harry’s shoulder, knocking him 
sideways. A split second later he realized that Neville had just charged 
past him, heading straight for Malfoy. 
“Neville, no!” 
Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville’s robes; Neville 
struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Mal-
foy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked. 
“Help me!” Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around 
Neville’s neck and dragging him backward, away from the Slytherins. 
Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing their arms, closing in front of 
Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron hurried forward and seized Neville’s 
arms; together, he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into 
the Gryffindor line. Neville’s face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was 
exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd 
words spluttered from his mouth. 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 362  
“Not. . . funny . . . don’t . . . Mungo’s . . . show . . . him . . .” 
The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His black eyes 
swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were 
wrestling with Neville. 
“Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?” Snape said in his cold, 
sneering voice. “Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, 
Potter, or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.” 
Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him. 
“I had to stop you,” Harry gasped, picking up his bag. “Crabbe and 
Goyle would’ve torn you apart.” 
Neville said nothing, he merely snatched up his own bag and 
stalked off into the dungeon. 
“What in the name of Merlin,” said Ron slowly, as they followed 
Neville, “was that about?” 
Harry did not answer. He knew exactly why the subject of people 
who were in St. Mungo’s because of magical damage to their brains 
was highly distressing to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore 
that he would not tell anyone Neville’s secret. Even Neville did not 
know that Harry knew. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the 
class and pulled out parchment, quills, and their copies of One Thou-
sand Magical Herbs and Fungi. The class around them was whispering 
about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dun-
geon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately. 
“You will notice,” said Snape in his low, sneering voice, “that we 
have a guest with us today.” 
He gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon, and Harry saw 
Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. He glanced 
sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and Um-
bridge, the two teachers he hated most . . . it was hard to decide 
which he wanted to triumph over the other.

“We are continuing with our Strengthening Solutions today, you 
will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson, if correctly made 
they should have matured well over the weekend — instructions” — 
he waved his wand again — “on the board. Carry on.” 
Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making 
notes in her corner. Harry was very interested in hearing her question 
Snape, so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion 
again. 
“Salamander blood, Harry!” Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist 
to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time. “Not 
pomegranate juice!” 
“Right,” said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continu-
ing to watch the corner. Umbridge had just gotten to her feet. “Ha,” 
he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks toward Snape, 
who was bending over Dean Thomas’s cauldron. 
“Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,” she said 
briskly to Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is ad-
visable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think 
the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.” 
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her. 
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she 
asked, her quill poised over her clipboard. 
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. 
His eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed 
menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange. 
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I 
believe?” Professor Umbridge asked Snape. 
“Yes,” said Snape quietly. 
“But you were unsuccessful?” 
Snape’s lip curled. 
“Obviously.” 
 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 364  
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. 
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark 
Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?” 
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very 
angry. 
“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused 
to appoint you?” asked Umbridge. 
“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily. 
“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile. 
“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed. 
“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry wants a 
thorough understanding of teachers’ — er — backgrounds. . . .” 
She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began ques-
tioning her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their 
eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, 
which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of 
burned rubber. 
“No marks again, then, Potter,” said Snape maliciously, emptying 
Harry’s cauldron with a wave of his wand. “You will write me an essay 
on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why 
you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?” 
“Yes,” said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them home-
work, and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean 
another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem possible that he had 
awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a fervent 
desire for this day to end as soon as possible. 
“Maybe I’ll skive off Divination,” he said glumly as they stood 
again in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of 
robes and brims of hats. “I’ll pretend to be ill and do Snape’s essay in-
stead, then I won’t have to stay up half the night. . . .” 
“You can’t skive off Divination,” said Hermione severely. 
 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE 
NUMBER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 365  
“Hark who’s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate 
Trelawney!” said Ron indignantly. 
“I don’t hate her,” said Hermione loftily. “I just think she’s an ab-
solutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. . . . But Harry’s already 
missed History of Magic and I don’t think he ought to miss anything 
else today!” 
There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later 
Harry took his seat in the hot, over-perfumed atmosphere of the Div-
ination classroom feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was 
handing out copies of The Dream Oracle yet again; he would surely be 
much better employed doing Snape’s punishment essay than sitting 
here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams. 
It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination 
who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Or-
acle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her 
lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and 
Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, and thrust the final one into 
Neville’s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf. 
“Well, carry on!” said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high 
pitched and somewhat hysterical. “You know what to do! Or am I such 
a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?” 
The class stared perplexedly at her and then at each other. Harry, 
however, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor 
Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teacher’s chair, her mag-
nified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron’s and 
muttered, “I think she’s got the results of her inspection back.” 
“Professor?” said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender 
had always rather admired Professor Trelawney). “Professor, is there 
anything — er — wrong?” 
“Wrong!” cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emo-
tion. “Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly. . . . Insinuations  
 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 366  
have been made against me. . . . Unfounded accusations levelled . . . 
but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not. . . .” 
She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, 
angry tears spilling from under her glasses. 
“I say nothing,” she choked, “of sixteen years’ devoted service. . . . 
It has passed, apparently, unnoticed. . . . But I shall not be insulted, 
no, I shall not!” 
“But Professor, who’s insulting you?” asked Parvati timidly. 
“The establishment!” said Professor Trelawney in a deep, dramatic, 
wavering voice. “Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to 
See as I See, to Know as I Know . . . Of course, we Seers have always 
been feared, always persecuted. . . . It is — alas — our fate. . . .” 
She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, 
and then pulled a small, embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, 
into which she blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blow-
ing a raspberry. Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a disgusted look. 
“Professor,” said Parvati, “do you mean . . . is it something Profes-
sor Umbridge . . . ?” 
“Do not speak to me about that woman!” cried Professor 
Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles 
flashing. “Kindly continue with your work!” 
And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still 
leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats 
under her breath. 
“. . . may well choose to leave . . . the indignity of it . . . on proba-
tion . . . we shall see . . . how she dares . . .” 
“You and Umbridge have got something in common,” Harry told 
Hermione quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark 
Arts. “She obviously reckons Trelawney’s an old fraud too. . . . Looks 
like she’s put her on probation.” 
Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet 
bow and an expression of great smugness. 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE

“Good afternoon, class.” 
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted drearily. 
“Wands away, please . . .” 
But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody 
had bothered to take out their wands. 
“Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read 
the third chapter, entitled ‘The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to 
Magical Attack.’ There will be —” 
“— no need to talk,” Harry, Ron, and Hermione said together un-
der their breaths. 
 
“No Quidditch practice,” said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione entered the common room that night after 
dinner. 
“But I kept my temper!” said Harry, horrified. “I didn’t say any-
thing to her, Angelina, I swear, I —” 
“I know, I know,” said Angelina miserably. “She just said she 
needed a bit of time to consider.” 
“Consider what?” said Ron angrily. “She’s given the Slytherins per-
mission, why not us?” 
But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying hold-
ing the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and 
could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that 
weapon over them too soon. 
“Well,” said Hermione, “look on the bright side — at least now 
you’ll have time to do Snape’s essay!” 
“That’s a bright side, is it?” snapped Harry, while Ron stared in-
credulously at Hermione. “No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?” 
Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluc-
tantly from his bag, and set to work. 
It was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew that Sirius 
was not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing

into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was also an in-
credible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared fi-
nally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were 
taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd. 
First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at 
which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in 
front of them. Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, 
at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was 
assisting the demonstration, was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular 
intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry’s 
potions. 
What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering, and Fred and 
George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it 
exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthen-
ing Solutions. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and 
sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George’s bucket were 
punctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if any-
thing, more distracting. 
“Just go and stop them, then!” he said irritably, after crossing out 
the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time. 
“I can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong,” said Her-
mione through gritted teeth. “They’re quite within their rights to eat 
the foul things themselves, and I can’t find a rule that says the other 
idiots aren’t entitled to buy them, not unless they’re proven to be dan-
gerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though they are. . . .” 
She, Harry, and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the 
bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and straighten up, beaming 
with his arms wide to protracted applause. 
“You know, I don’t get why Fred and George only got three O.W.L.s 
each,” said Harry, watching as Fred, George, and Lee collected gold 
from the eager crowd. “They really know their stuff. . . .” 
 
EDUCATIONAL  DECREE 
NUMBER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 369  
“Oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s no real use to anyone,” said 
Hermione disparagingly. 
“No real use?” said Ron in a strained voice. “Hermione, they’ve got 
about twenty-six Galleons already. . . .” 
It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed, 
and then Fred, Lee, and George sat up counting their takings even 
longer, so that it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione finally had the common room to themselves again. At long 
last, Fred closed the doorway to the boys’ dormitories behind him, 
rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. 
Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, de-
cided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who 
was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, 
looked blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!” 
Harry whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was sitting in the 
fire again. 
“Hi,” he said, grinning. 
“Hi,” chorused Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all three kneeling 
down upon the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and ap-
proached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to 
Sirius’s. 
“How’re things?” said Sirius. 
“Not that good,” said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks 
back to stop him singeing his whiskers. “The Ministry’s forced 
through another decree, which means we’re not allowed to have Quid-
ditch teams —” 
“— or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups?” said Sirius. 
There was a short pause. 
“How did you know about that?” Harry demanded. 
“You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,” said Sir-
ius, grinning still more broadly. “The Hog’s Head, I ask you . . .” 
 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 370  
“Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!” said Hermione 
defensively. “That’s always packed with people —” 
“— which means you’d have been harder to overhear,” said Sirius. 
“You’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.” 
“Who overheard us?” Harry demanded. 
“Mundungus, of course,” said Sirius, and when they all looked 
puzzled he laughed. “He was the witch under the veil.” 
“That was Mundungus?” Harry said, stunned. “What was he doing 
in the Hog’s Head?” 
“What do you think he was doing?” said Sirius impatiently. “Keep-
ing an eye on you, of course.” 
“I’m still being followed?” asked Harry angrily. 
“Yeah, you are,” said Sirius, “and just as well, isn’t it, if the first 
thing you’re going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal de-
fense group.” 
But he looked neither angry nor worried; on the contrary, he was 
looking at Harry with distinct pride. 
“Why was Dung hiding from us?” asked Ron, sounding disap-
pointed. “We’d’ve liked to’ve seen him.” 
“He was banned from the Hog’s Head twenty years ago,” said Sirius, 
“and that barman’s got a long memory. We lost Moody’s spare Invisi-
bility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung’s been dressing as a 
witch a lot lately. . . . Anyway . . . First of all, Ron — I’ve sworn to 
pass on a message from your mother.” 
“Oh yeah?” said Ron, sounding apprehensive. 
“She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an ille-
gal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group. She says you’ll be ex-
pelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there will be 
plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are 
too young to be worrying about that right now. She also” — Sirius’s 
eyes turned to the other two — “advises Harry and Hermione not to 
proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority

over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has 
their best interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but 
if the owl had been intercepted you’d all have been in real trouble, and 
she can’t say it for herself because she’s on duty tonight.” 
“On duty doing what?” said Ron quickly. 
“Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,” said Sirius. “So it’s 
fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it 
all on, because I don’t think she trusts me to.” 
There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, at-
tempted to paw Sirius’s head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the 
hearthrug. 
“So you want me to say I’m not going to take part in the defense 
group?” he muttered finally. 
“Me? Certainly not!” said Sirius, looking surprised. “I think it’s an 
excellent idea!” 
“You do?” said Harry, his heart lifting. 
“Of course I do!” said Sirius. “D’you think your father and I 
would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?” 
“But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take 
risks —” 
“Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was 
trying to kill you, Harry!” said Sirius impatiently. “This year we know 
that there’s someone outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I 
think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!” 
“And if we do get expelled?” Hermione asked, a quizzical look on 
her face. 
“Hermione, this whole thing was your idea!” said Harry, staring at 
her. 
“I know it was. . . . I just wondered what Sirius thought,” she said, 
shrugging. 
“Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting 
safely in school without a clue,” said Sirius. 
CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN 
 372  
“Hear, hear,” said Harry and Ron enthusiastically. 
“So,” said Sirius, “how are you organizing this group? Where are 
you meeting?” 
“Well, that’s a bit of a problem now,” said Harry. “Dunno where 
we’re going to be able to go. . . .” 
“How about the Shrieking Shack?” suggested Sirius. 
“Hey, that’s an idea!” said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a 
skeptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius’s head turn-
ing in the flames. 
“Well, Sirius, it’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the 
Shrieking Shack when you were at school,” said Hermione, “and all of 
you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have 
squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you’d wanted to. But there 
are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn’t 
need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee —” 
“Fair point,” said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. “Well, I’m sure 
you’ll come up with somewhere. . . . There used to be a pretty roomy 
secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you 
might have enough space to practice jinxes in there —” 
“Fred and George told me it’s blocked,” said Harry, shaking his 
head. “Caved in or something.” 
“Oh . . .” said Sirius, frowning. “Well, I’ll have a think and get 
back to —” 
He broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned 
sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace. 
“Sirius?” said Harry anxiously. 
But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then 
turned to look at Ron and Hermione. 
“Why did he — ?” 
Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at 
the fire.

A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to 
catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in 
ugly old-fashioned rings. . . . 
The three of them ran for it; at the door of the boys’ dormitory 
Harry looked back. Umbridge’s hand was still making snatching 
movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where 
Sirius’s hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.

mbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s no other 
explanation.” 
“You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?” he said, outraged. 
“I’m almost certain of it,” said Hermione grimly. “Watch your frog, 
it’s escaping.” 
Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping 
hopefully toward the other side of the table — “Accio!”— and it 
zoomed gloomily back into his hand. 
Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a pri-
vate chat: There was generally so much movement and activity that 
the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room 
full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy down-
pour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s whispered discussion about how Um-
bridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed. 
“I’ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering 
Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,” Hermione whis-
pered. “I mean, once your letter had been read, it would have been

quite clear you weren’t ordering them, so you wouldn’t have been in 
trouble at all — it’s a bit of a feeble joke, isn’t it? But then I thought, 
what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, 
it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch, 
let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a 
way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it — I don’t think 
Filch would object, when’s he ever stuck up for a student’s rights? 
Harry, you’re squashing your frog.” 
Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly 
its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk. 
“It was a very, very close call last night,” said Hermione. “I just 
wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!” 
The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was 
struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully. 
“If she’d caught Snuffles . . .” 
Harry finished the sentence for her. 
“He’d probably be back in Azkaban this morning.” He waved his 
wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green 
balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle. 
“Silencio!” said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry’s 
frog, which deflated silently before them. “Well, he mustn’t do it 
again, that’s all. I just don’t know how we’re going to let him know. We 
can’t send him an owl.” 
“I don’t reckon he’ll risk it again,” said Ron. “He’s not stupid, he 
knows she nearly got him. Silencio!” 
The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw. 
“Silencio! SILENCIO!” 
The raven cawed more loudly. 
“It’s the way you’re moving your wand,” said Hermione, watching 
Ron critically. “You don’t want to wave it, it’s more a sharp jab.” 
“Ravens are harder than frogs,” said Ron testily. 
“Fine, let’s swap,” said Hermione, seizing Ron’s raven and replacing 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 376  
it with her own fat bullfrog. “Silencio!” The raven continued to open 
and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out. 
“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s squeaky little 
voice and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all jumped. “Now, let me see 
you try, Mr. Weasley!” 
“Wha — ? Oh — oh, right,” said Ron, very flustered. “Er — Silencio!” 
He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in the eye; the 
frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk. 
It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were 
given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework. 
They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the down-
pour outside. They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom 
on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the 
chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody’s 
head. They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling to-
ward them through the groups of gossiping students. 
“I’ve got permission!” she said. “To re-form the Quidditch team!” 
“Excellent!” said Ron and Harry together. 
“Yeah,” said Angelina, beaming. “I went to McGonagall and I think  
she might have appealed to Dumbledore — anyway, Umbridge had 
to give in. Ha! So I want you down at the pitch at seven o’clock 
tonight, all right, because we’ve got to make up time, you realize we’re 
only three weeks away from our first match?” 
She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from 
Peeves, which hit a nearby first year instead, and vanished from sight. 
Ron’s smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which 
was now opaque with hammering rain. 
“Hope this clears up . . . What’s up with you, Hermione?” 
She too was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw 
it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face. 
“Just thinking . . .” she said, still frowning at the rain-washed 
window. 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 377  
“About Siri . . . Snuffles?” said Harry. 
“No . . . not exactly . . .” said Hermione slowly. “More . . . won-
dering . . . I suppose we’re doing the right thing . . . I think . . . aren’t 
we? 
Harry and Ron looked at each other. 
“Well, that clears that up,” said Ron. “It would’ve been really an-
noying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.” 
Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he 
was there. 
“I was just wondering,” she said, her voice stronger now, “whether 
we’re doing the right thing, starting this Defense Against the Dark 
Arts group.” 
“What!” said Harry and Ron together. 
“Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!” said Ron 
indignantly. 
“I know,” said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. “But after 
talking to Snuffles . . .” 
“But he’s all for it!” said Harry. 
“Yes,” said Hermione, staring at the window again. “Yes, that’s 
what made me think maybe it wasn’t a good idea after all. . . .” 
Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready; 
automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads 
until he had passed. 
“Let’s get this straight,” said Harry angrily, as they put their bags 
back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with us, so you don’t think we should 
do it anymore?” 
Hermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now staring at her 
own hands she said, “Do you honestly trust his judgment?” 
“Yes, I do!” said Harry at once. “He’s always given us great advice!” 
An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in 
the ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throw-
ing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 378  
again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very 
carefully. 
“You don’t think he has become . . . sort of . . . reckless . . . since 
he’s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? You don’t think he’s . . . 
kind of . . . living through us?” 
“What d’you mean, ‘living through us’?” Harry retorted. 
“I mean . . . well, I think he’d love to be forming secret defense 
societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry. . . . I 
think he’s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is . . . so 
I think he’s keen to kind of . . . egg us on.” 
Ron looked utterly perplexed. 
“Sirius is right,” he said, “you do sound just like my mother.” 
Hermione bit her lip and did not answer. The bell rang just as 
Peeves swooped down upon Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle 
over her head. 
 
The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven 
o’clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quid-
ditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, 
their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was a deep, 
thundery gray and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the 
changing rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary. 
They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their 
own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying. 
“— but I bet she’d know what we’d done,” Fred said out of the cor-
ner of his mouth. “If only I hadn’t offered to sell her some Puking 
Pastilles yesterday —” 
“We could try the Fever Fudge,” George muttered, “no one’s seen 
that yet —” 
“Does it work?” inquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain 
on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building. 
“Well, yeah,” said Fred, “your temperature’ll go right up —” 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 379  
“— but you get these massive pus-filled boils too,” said George, 
“and we haven’t worked out how to get rid of them yet.” 
“I can’t see any boils,” said Ron, staring at the twins. 
“No, well, you wouldn’t,” said Fred darkly, “they’re not in a place 
we generally display to the public —” 
“— but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the —” 
“All right, everyone, listen up,” said Angelina loudly, emerging 
from the Captain’s office. “I know it’s not ideal weather, but there’s a 
good chance we’ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it’s a 
good idea to work out how we’re going to cope with them. Harry, 
didn’t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them 
up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm?” 
“Hermione did it,” said Harry. He pulled out his wand, tapped his 
glasses and said, “Impervius!” 
“I think we all ought to try that,” said Angelina. “If we could just 
keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility — all to-
gether, come on — Impervius! Okay. Let’s go.” 
They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their 
robes, shouldered their brooms, and followed Angelina out of the 
changing rooms. 
They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the 
pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; 
light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds. 
“All right, on my whistle,” shouted Angelina. 
Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, 
and shot upward, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no 
idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was hav-
ing enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were 
practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he 
had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately Angelina did 
not see this; in fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; 
none of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 380  
picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pound-
ing sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake. 
Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding de-
feat. She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing 
rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though 
without any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were look-
ing particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with 
every movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as 
he toweled his hair dry. 
“I think a few of mine have ruptured,” said Fred in a hollow voice. 
“Mine haven’t,” said George, wincing. “They’re throbbing like mad 
. . . feel bigger if anything . . .” 
“OUCH!” said Harry. 
He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain. 
The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than in 
months. 
“What’s up?” said several voices. 
Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was 
blurred because he was not wearing his glasses; but he could still tell 
that everyone’s face was turned toward him. 
“Nothing,” he muttered, “I — poked myself in the eye, that’s 
all. . . .” 
But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back 
as the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their 
hats pulled low over their ears. 
“What happened?” said Ron, the moment that Alicia had disap-
peared through the door. “Was it your scar?” 
Harry nodded. 
“But . . .” Looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and 
stared out into the rain, “He — he can’t be near us now, can he?” 
“No,” Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing his  
 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 381  
forehead. “He’s probably miles away. It hurt because . . . he’s . . . 
angry.” 
Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as 
though a stranger had spoken them — yet he knew at once that they 
were true. He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, 
wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper. 
“Did you see him?” said Ron, looking horrified. “Did you . . . get a 
vision, or something?” 
Harry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his mind and his 
memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain. . . . 
A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices . . . 
“He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough,” 
he said. 
Again, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth, 
and yet quite certain that they were true. 
“But . . . how do you know?” said Ron. 
Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing 
down upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt 
Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at 
him. 
“Is this what it was about last time?” said Ron in a hushed voice. 
“When your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was 
angry?” 
Harry shook his head. 
“What is it, then?” 
Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Um-
bridge’s face. . . . His scar had hurt . . . and he had had that odd feel-
ing in his stomach . . . a strange, leaping feeling . . . a happy feeling. 
. . . But, of course, he had not recognized it for what it was, as he had 
been feeling so miserable himself. . . . 
“Last time, it was because he was pleased,” he said. “Really pleased. 
 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 382  
He thought . . . something good was going to happen. And the night 
before we came back to Hogwarts . . .” He thought back to the mo-
ment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron’s bedroom in 
Grimmauld Place. “He was furious. . . .” 
He looked around at Ron, who was gaping at him. 
“You could take over from Trelawney, mate,” he said in an awed 
voice. 
“I’m not making prophecies,” said Harry. 
“No, you know what you’re doing?” Ron said, sounding both scared 
and impressed. “Harry, you’re reading You-Know-Who’s mind. . . .” 
“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It’s more like . . . his mood, I 
suppose. I’m just getting flashes of what mood he’s in. . . . Dumble-
dore said something like this was happening last year. . . . He said that 
when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could 
tell. Well, now I’m feeling it when he’s pleased too. . . .” 
There was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the building. 
“You’ve got to tell someone,” said Ron. 
“I told Sirius last time.” 
“Well, tell him about this time!” 
“Can’t, can I?” said Harry grimly. “Umbridge is watching the owls 
and the fires, remember?” 
“Well then, Dumbledore —” 
“I’ve just told you, he already knows,” said Harry shortly, getting to 
his feet, taking his cloak off his peg, and swinging it around himself. 
“There’s no point telling him again.” 
Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry 
thoughtfully. 
“Dumbledore’d want to know,” he said. 
Harry shrugged. 
“C’mon . . . we’ve still got Silencing Charms to practice . . .” 
They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stum-
bling up the muddy lawns, not talking. Harry was thinking hard. 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 383  
What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening 
quickly enough? 
“He’s got other plans . . . plans he can put into operation very quietly 
indeed . . . stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something 
he didn’t have last time.” 
He had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too 
absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the 
ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry inter-
ference. . . . But now they came back to him and made him wonder. 
. . . Voldemort’s anger would make sense if he was no nearer laying 
hands on the weapon, whatever it was. . . . Had the Order thwarted 
him, stopped him from seizing it? Where was it kept? Who had it now? 
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Ron’s voice and Harry came back to 
his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the 
common room. 
It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crook-
shanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted 
elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she 
was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar 
hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore too. Ron kept 
throwing him anxious glances, but Harry pulled out his Potions book 
and set to work to finish his essay, though he was only pretending to 
concentrate and, by the time that Ron said he was going to bed too, 
had written hardly anything. 
Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a 
passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage, and sneezewort and not 
taking in a word of it. . . . 
These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and 
are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where 
the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness. . . . 
. . . Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in 
Grimmauld Place. . . . 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 384  
. . . moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore 
much used . . . 
. . . the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they 
found out that he knew what Voldemort was feeling . . . 
. . . therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts . . . 
. . . confusing was the word, all right; why did he know what Volde-
mort was feeling? What was this weird connection between them, 
which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily? 
. . . where the wizard is desirous . . . 
. . . how he would like to sleep . . . 
. . . of producing hot-headedness . . . 
. . . It was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire, 
with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes and Crook-
shanks purring and the crackling of the flames. . . . 
The book slipped from Harry’s slack grip and landed with a dull 
thud on the hearthrug. His head fell sideways. . . . 
He was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his foot-
steps echoing in the silence. As the door at the end of the passage 
loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement. . . . If he could only 
open it . . . enter beyond . . . 
He stretched out his hand. . . . His fingertips were inches from it. . . . 
“Harry Potter, sir!” 
He awoke with a start. The candles had all been extinguished in the 
common room, but there was something moving close by. 
“Whozair?” said Harry, sitting upright in his chair. The fire was al-
most extinguished, the room very dark. 
“Dobby has your owl, sir!” said a squeaky voice. 
“Dobby?” said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom toward 
the source of the voice. 
Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which 
Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hats. His large, pointed 
ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 385  
that Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the 
other, so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on 
the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously 
cured. 
“Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said the elf 
squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face. “Professor 
Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir!” 
He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the 
threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant 
hoot and fluttered onto the arm of Harry’s chair. 
“Thanks, Dobby!” said Harry, stroking Hedwig’s head and blinking 
hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream. . . . 
It had been very vivid. . . . Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the 
elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his 
feet looked far too big for his body. 
“Er . . . have you been taking all  the clothes Hermione’s been leav-
ing out?” 
“Oh no, sir,” said Dobby happily, “Dobby has been taking some for 
Winky too, sir.” 
“Yeah, how is Winky?” asked Harry. 
Dobby’s ears drooped slightly. 
“Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his enormous round 
green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. “She still does not care for 
clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them 
will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hid-
den everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all him-
self, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet 
Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!” Dobby sank into a 
deep bow again. “But Harry Potter does not seem happy,” Dobby 
went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry. 
“Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having 
bad dreams?” 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 386  
“Not really bad,” said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes. “I’ve 
had worse.” 
The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes. Then he said 
very seriously, his ears drooping, “Dobby wishes he could help Harry 
Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much 
happier now. . . .” 
Harry smiled. 
“You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer. . . .” 
He bent and picked up his Potions book. He’d have to try and fin-
ish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the fire-
light illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand — the 
result of his detention with Umbridge. 
“Wait a moment — there is something you can do for me, Dobby,” 
said Harry slowly. 
The elf looked around, beaming. 
“Name it, Harry Potter, sir!” 
“I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practice De-
fense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the 
teachers. Especially,” Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that 
the scars shone pearly white, “Professor Umbridge.” 
He expected the elf’s smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected 
him to say that this was impossible, or else that he would try, but his 
hopes were not high. . . . What he had not expected was for Dobby to 
give a little skip, his ears waggling happily, and clap his hands together. 
“Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!” he said happily. “Dobby 
heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, 
sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the 
Room of Requirement!” 
“Why?” said Harry curiously. 
“Because it is a room that a person can only enter,” said Dobby se-
riously, “when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and 
sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 387  
seeker’s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,” said the elf, dropping his voice 
and looking guilty, “when Winky has been very drunk. He has hidden 
her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to 
butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she 
sleeps it off, sir. . . . And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra 
cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and —” 
“— and if you really needed a bathroom,” said Harry, suddenly re-
membering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the pre-
vious Christmas, “would it fill itself with chamber pots?” 
“Dobby expects so, sir,” said Dobby, nodding earnestly. “It is a 
most amazing room, sir.” 
“How many people know about it?” said Harry, sitting up straighter 
in his chair. 
“Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, 
sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is 
always there waiting to be called into service, sir.” 
“It sounds brilliant,” said Harry, his heart racing. “It sounds per-
fect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?” 
“Anytime, Harry Potter, sir,” said Dobby, looking delighted at 
Harry’s enthusiasm. “We could go now, if you like!” 
For a moment Harry was tempted to go now; he was halfway out 
of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, 
not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione’s whispered in 
his ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted and had 
Snape’s essay to finish. 
“Not tonight, Dobby,” said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his 
chair. “This is really important. . . . I don’t want to blow it, it’ll need 
proper planning. . . . Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this 
Room of Requirement is and how to get in there?” 
 
Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across 
the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology, where they could 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 388  
hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of 
raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoon’s 
Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-
swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their 
intense relief, Angelina sought out her team at lunch to tell them that 
Quidditch practice was canceled. 
“Good,” said Harry quietly, when she told him, “because we’ve 
found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting. Tonight, eight 
o’clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy 
being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?” 
She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others; 
Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked 
up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching 
him. 
“What?” he said thickly. 
“Well . . . it’s just that Dobby’s plans aren’t always that safe. Don’t 
you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?” 
“This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s; Dumbledore 
knows about it too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.” 
Hermione’s expression cleared. 
“Dumbledore told you about it?” 
“Just in passing,” said Harry, shrugging. 
“Oh well, that’s all right then,” said Hermione briskly and she 
raised no more objections. 
Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out 
those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog’s Head 
and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry’s 
disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and 
her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that 
the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who 
had turned up in the Hog’s Head. 
At half-past seven Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the Gryffindor 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 389  
common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in 
his hand. Fifth years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine 
o’clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they 
made their way up to the seventh floor. 
“Hold it,” said Harry warningly, unfolding the piece of parchment 
at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand, and mutter-
ing, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” 
A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parch-
ment. Tiny black moving dots, labeled with names, showed where 
various people were. 
“Filch is on the second floor,” said Harry, holding the map close to 
his eyes and scanning it closely, “and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.” 
“And Umbridge?” said Hermione anxiously. 
“In her office,” said Harry, pointing. “Okay, let’s go.” 
They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described 
to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry de-
picting Barnabas the Barmy’s foolish attempt to train trolls for the 
ballet. 
“Okay,” said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his 
relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch. “Dobby 
said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on 
what we need.” 
They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank 
stretch of wall, then at the man-size vase on its other side. Ron had 
screwed up his eyes in concentration, Hermione was whispering 
something under her breath, Harry’s fists were clenched as he stared 
ahead of him. 
We need somewhere to learn to fight. . . . he thought. Just give us a 
place to practice . . . somewhere they can’t find us . . . 
“Harry,” said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their 
third walk past. 
A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 390  
at it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, 
pulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with 
flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors 
below. 
The walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs 
there were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far 
end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, 
Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure 
had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody’s office. 
“These will be good when we’re practicing Stunning,” said Ron 
enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot. 
“And just look at these books!” said Hermione excitedly, running a 
finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. “A Com-
pendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark 
Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . .” She looked 
around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of 
hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they 
were doing was right. “Harry, this is wonderful, there’s everything we 
need here!” 
And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, 
sank onto the nearest cushion, and began to read. 
There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked around; 
Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean had arrived. 
“Whoa,” said Dean, staring around, impressed. “What is this 
place?” 
Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people 
had arrived, and he had to start all over again. By the time eight 
o’clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to 
the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a 
satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. 
Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the 
book aside. 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 391  
“Well,” said Harry, slightly nervously. “This is the place we’ve 
found for practices, and you’ve — er — obviously found it okay —” 
“It’s fantastic!” said Cho, and several people murmured their 
agreement. 
“It’s bizarre,” said Fred, frowning around at it. “We once hid from 
Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard 
then. . . .” 
“Hey, Harry, what’s this stuff?” asked Dean from the rear of the 
room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass. 
“Dark Detectors,” said Harry, stepping between the cushions to 
reach them. “Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies 
are around, but you don’t want to rely on them too much, they can be 
fooled. . . .” 
He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy fig-
ures were moving around inside it, though none was recognizable. He 
turned his back on it. 
“Well, I’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first 
and — er —” He noticed a raised hand. “What, Hermione?” 
“I think we ought to elect a leader,” said Hermione. 
“Harry’s leader,” said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though 
she were mad, and Harry’s stomach did yet another back flip. 
“Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,” said Hermione, 
unperturbed. “It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So — 
everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?” 
Everybody put up their hands, even Zacharias Smith, though he 
did it very halfheartedly. 
“Er — right, thanks,” said Harry, who could feel his face burning. 
“And — what, Hermione?” 
“I also think we ought to have a name,” she said brightly, her hand 
still in the air. “It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, 
don’t you think?” 
“Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?” said Angelina hopefully.

“Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?” suggested Fred. 
“I was thinking,” said Hermione, frowning at Fred, “more of a 
name that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to 
it safely outside meetings.” 
“The Defense Association?” said Cho. “The D.A. for short, so no-
body knows what we’re talking about?” 
“Yeah, the D.A.’s good,” said Ginny. “Only let’s make it stand for 
Dumbledore’s Army because that’s the Ministry’s worst fear, isn’t it?” 
There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at 
this. 
“All in favor of the D.A.?” said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on 
her cushion to count. “That’s a majority — motion passed!” 
She pinned the piece of paper with all of their names on it on the 
wall and wrote DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY across the top in large 
letters. 
“Right,” said Harry, when she had sat down again, “shall we get 
practicing then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expel-
liarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it’s pretty basic but 
I’ve found it really useful —” 
“Oh please,” said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his 
arms. “I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against 
You-Know-Who, do you?” 
“I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved my life last 
June.” 
Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very 
quiet. 
“But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave,” Harry said. 
Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else. 
“Okay,” said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all 
those eyes upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and 
practice.” 
It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 393  
seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided 
up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless. 
“You can practice with me,” Harry told him. “Right — on the 
count of three, then — one, two, three —” 
The room was suddenly full of shouts of “Expelliarmus!”: Wands 
flew in all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them 
flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went 
spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and 
landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry re-
trieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around he thought he 
had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was 
a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding 
in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump 
backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over 
them. 
“Expelliarmus!” said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his 
wand fly out of his hand. 
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I 
DID IT!” 
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out 
that in a real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be star-
ing in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. 
“Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and 
Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how 
the rest are doing?” 
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd 
was happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth 
to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his 
hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not 
have to look far for the solution of the mystery, however; Fred and 
George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point 
their wands at his back. 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 394  
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. 
“Couldn’t resist . . .” 
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who 
were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; 
she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or un-
willing to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnec-
essarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey 
brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all 
the books leaping off the shelves around them. Luna Lovegood was 
similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley’s wand 
spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to 
stand on end. 
“Okay, stop!” Harry shouted. “Stop! STOP!” 
I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on 
top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Every-
one lowered their wands. 
“That wasn’t bad,” said Harry, “but there’s definite room for im-
provement.” Zacharias Smith glared at him. “Let’s try again. . . .” 
He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to 
make suggestions. Slowly the general performance improved. He 
avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking 
twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore 
them any longer. 
“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached. “Expelliarmious! 
I mean, Expellimellius! I — oh, sorry, Marietta!” 
Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extin-
guished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his 
fault. 
“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” Cho told 
Harry ruefully. 
“That was quite good,” Harry lied, but when she raised her eye- 
 
DUMBLEDORE’S  ARMY 
 395  
brows he said, “Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it prop-
erly, I was watching from over there. . . .” 
She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and 
turned away. 
“Don’t mind her,” Cho muttered. “She doesn’t really want to be 
here but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to 
do anything that might upset Umbridge, you see — her mum works 
for the Ministry.” 
“What about your parents?” asked Harry. 
“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge 
too,” said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. “But if they think I’m not 
going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric —” 
She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell 
between them; Terry Boot’s wand went whizzing past Harry’s ear and 
hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose. 
“Well, my father is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!” 
said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she 
had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-
Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had 
flown up over his head. “He’s always saying he’d believe anything of 
Fudge, I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! 
And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible 
poisons, which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him. 
And then there’s his Umgubular Slashkilter —” 
“Don’t ask,” Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, 
looking puzzled. She giggled. 
“Hey, Harry,” Hermione called from the other end of the room, 
“have you checked the time?” 
He looked down at his watch and received a shock — it was al-
ready ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their 
common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by  
 
CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN 
 396  
Filch for being out-of-bounds. He blew his whistle; everybody 
stopped shouting, “Expelliarmus!” and the last couple of wands clat-
tered to the floor. 
“Well, that was pretty good,” said Harry, “but we’ve overrun, we’d 
better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?” 
“Sooner!” said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in 
agreement. 
Angelina, however, said quickly, “The Quidditch season’s about to 
start, we need team practices too!” 
“Let’s say next Wednesday night, then,” said Harry, “and we can 
decide on additional meetings then. . . . Come on, we’d better get 
going. . . .” 
He pulled out the Marauder’s Map again and checked it carefully 
for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in 
threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they re-
turned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement 
corridor that also led to the kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the 
west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the 
seventh floor and the Fat Lady’s portrait. 
“That was really, really good, Harry,” said Hermione, when finally 
it was just her, Harry, and Ron left. 
“Yeah, it was!” said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the 
door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. “Did you see 
me disarm Hermione, Harry?” 
“Only once,” said Hermione, stung. “I got you loads more than 
you got me —” 
“I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times —” 
“Well, if you’re counting the one where you tripped over your own 
feet and knocked the wand out of my hand —” 
They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was 
not listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder’s Map, but he 
was also thinking of how Cho had said he made her nervous. . . .

arry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman 
inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing se-
cret that supported him through Umbridge’s classes and even made it 
possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible 
bulging eyes. He and the D.A. were resisting her under her very nose, 
doing the very thing that she and the Ministry most feared, and when-
ever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during 
her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most re-
cent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed 
Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx af-
ter three meetings’ hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a 
good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the 
Sneakoscopes to dust. 
He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the 
week for D.A. meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate 
Quidditch teams’ practices, which were often rearranged depending on 
the weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this, he had a 
feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings 
H 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 398  
unpredictable. If anyone was watching them, it would be hard to make 
out a pattern. 
Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating 
the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they 
needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspi-
cious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great 
Hall to talk to each other too often. She gave each of the members of 
the D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he saw the 
basket at first, convinced that she was actually giving out gold). 
“You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” Hermione 
said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meet-
ing. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. 
“On real Galleons that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin 
who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will 
change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will 
grow hot when the date changes, so if you’re carrying them in a pocket 
you’ll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the 
date of the next meeting he’ll change the numbers on his coin, and be-
cause I’ve put a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic 
his.” 
A blank silence greeted Hermione’s words. She looked around at all 
the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted. 
“Well — I thought it was a good idea,” she said uncertainly, “I 
mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there’s 
nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But . . . well, if you 
don’t want to use them . . .” 
“You can do a Protean Charm?” said Terry Boot. 
“Yes,” said Hermione. 
“But that’s . . . that’s N.E.W.T. standard, that is,” he said weakly. 
“Oh,” said Hermione, trying to look modest. “Oh . . . well . . . yes, 
I suppose it is. . . .” 
 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 399  
“How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” he demanded, staring at 
Hermione with something close to wonder. “With brains like yours?” 
“Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Raven-
claw during my Sorting,” said Hermione brightly, “but it decided on 
Gryffindor in the end. So does that mean we’re using the Galleons?” 
There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to 
collect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. 
“You know what these remind me of?” 
“No, what’s that?” 
“The Death Eaters’ scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all 
their scars burn, and they know they’ve got to join him.” 
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione quietly. “That is where I got the idea 
. . . but you’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal 
rather than on our members’ skin. . . .” 
“Yeah . . . I prefer your way,” said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his 
Galleon into his pocket. “I suppose the only danger with these is that 
we might accidentally spend them.” 
“Fat chance,” said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon 
with a slightly mournful air. “I haven’t got any real Galleons to con-
fuse it with.” 
As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus 
Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A. meetings were put on hold because 
Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quid-
ditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the in-
terest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game. The 
Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the out-
come, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the com-
ing year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though 
they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsman-
ship, were determined to see their side’s victory. Harry realized how 
much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she  
 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 400  
abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the 
match. 
“I think you’ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment,” 
she said loftily. Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked 
directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed 
to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t 
want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to 
practice, won’t you?” 
Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quid-
ditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had 
difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the 
many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the 
corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with 
her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision 
and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have at-
tempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to 
the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the 
Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx 
while she worked in the library. 
Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all, 
never lost to Malfoy’s team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing 
to Wood’s standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. 
His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he 
made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was 
therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron 
make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one 
memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and 
kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the 
length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The 
rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made re-
cently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland’s 
top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 401  
yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously consid-
ering admitting that he was related to them, something he assured 
Ron they had been trying to deny for four years. 
The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was al-
lowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even 
got onto the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide com-
ments for more than four years, so whispers of, “Hey, Potty, I heard 
Warrington’s sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday,” far 
from chilling his blood, made him laugh. “Warrington’s aim’s so pa-
thetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,” 
he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the 
smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face. 
But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers, and 
intimidation. When Slytherins, some of them seventh years and consid-
erably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, “Got 
your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?” he did not laugh, but 
turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron 
dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of 
each other), Ron’s ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he 
was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too. 
October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving 
rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every 
morning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies 
and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly gray, the moun-
tains around Hogwarts became snowcapped, and the temperature in 
the castle dropped so far that many students wore their thick protec-
tive dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons. 
The morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry 
awoke he looked around at Ron’s bed and saw him sitting bolt up-
right, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space. 
“You all right?” said Harry. 
Ron nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 402  
time that Ron had accidentally put a slug-vomiting charm on himself. 
He looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to men-
tion as reluctant to open his mouth. 
“You just need some breakfast,” Harry said bracingly. “C’mon.” 
The Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk 
louder and the mood more exuberant than usual. As they passed the 
Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around 
and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to the 
usual green-and-silver scarves and hats, silver badges in the shape of 
what seemed to be crowns. For some reason many of them waved at 
Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on 
the badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past 
their table quickly to linger long enough to read them. 
They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where 
everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron’s spirits 
the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he collapsed onto the 
nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal. 
“I must’ve been mental to do this,” he said in a croaky whisper. 
“Mental.” 
“Don’t be thick,” said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals. 
“You’re going to be fine. It’s normal to be nervous.” 
“I’m rubbish,” croaked Ron. “I’m lousy. I can’t play to save my life. 
What was I thinking?” 
“Get a grip,” said Harry sternly. “Look at that save you made with 
your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant —” 
Ron turned a tortured face to Harry. 
“That was an accident,” he whispered miserably. “I didn’t mean to 
do it — I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and 
I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.” 
“Well,” said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant sur-
prise, “a few more accidents like that and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?” 
 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 403  
Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red-and-
gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes. 
“How’re you feeling?” Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into 
the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though se-
riously considering attempting to drown himself in them. 
“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. 
“Well, that’s a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams 
if you’re not a bit nervous,” said Hermione heartily. 
“Hello,” said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry 
looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. 
Many people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and point-
ing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion’s 
head, which was perched precariously on her head. 
“I’m supporting Gryffindor,” said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at 
her hat. “Look what it does. . . .” 
She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It opened its 
mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone 
in the vicinity jump. 
“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna happily. “I wanted to have it chewing 
up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn’t time. 
Anyway . . . good luck, Ronald!” 
She drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of 
Luna’s hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them, accompanied 
by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to 
normal by Madam Pomfrey. 
“When you’re ready,” she said, “we’re going to go straight down to 
the pitch, check out conditions and change.” 
“We’ll be there in a bit,” Harry assured her. “Ron’s just got to have 
some breakfast.” 
It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capa-
ble of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him  
 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 404  
down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione 
got up too, and taking Harry’s arm, she drew him to one side. 
“Don’t let Ron see what’s on those Slytherins’ badges,” she whis-
pered urgently. 
Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warn-
ingly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate. 
“Good luck, Ron,” said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing 
him on the cheek. “And you, Harry —” 
Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across 
the Great Hall. He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had 
kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had 
just happened. He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, 
but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they 
passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched 
onto them: 
 
 
 
 
 
With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he 
hurried Ron across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out 
into the icy air. 
The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the 
sloping lawns toward the stadium. There was no wind at all and the 
sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be 
good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry 
pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he 
was not sure that Ron was listening. 
Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the 
team when they entered. Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron 
attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia 
tb^pibv

THE  SERPENT 
 405  
took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the 
pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder 
as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch. 
“Okay, I’ve only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin,” said 
Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment. “Last year’s Beaters, Der-
rick and Bole, have left now, but it looks as though Montague’s re-
placed them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly 
particularly well. They’re two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don’t 
know much about them —” 
“We do,” said Harry and Ron together. 
“Well, they don’t look bright enough to tell one end of a broom 
from another,” said Angelina, pocketing her parchment, “but then I 
was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way 
onto the pitch without signposts.” 
“Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold,” Harry assured her. 
They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked 
benches of the spectators’ stands now. Some people were singing, 
though Harry could not make out the words. He was starting to feel 
nervous, but he knew his butterflies were as nothing to Ron’s, who 
was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again, his jaw set 
and his complexion pale gray. 
“It’s time,” said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her watch. 
“C’mon everyone . . . good luck.” 
The team rose, shouldered their brooms, and marched in single file 
out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight. A roar of 
sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing, though it 
was muffled by the cheers and whistles. 
The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them. They too were 
wearing those silver crown-shaped badges. The new captain, Mon-
tague, was built along the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms 
like hairy hams. Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as 
large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters’ 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 406  
bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-
blond head. He caught Harry’s eye and smirked, tapping the crown-
shaped badge on his chest. 
“Captains shake hands,” ordered the umpire, Madam Hooch, as 
Angelina and Montague reached each other. Harry could tell that 
Montague was trying to crush Angelina’s fingers, though she did not 
wince. “Mount your brooms. . . .” 
Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew. 
The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out 
of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off toward the goal 
hoops. He zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide 
lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of 
the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same. 
“And it’s Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl 
is, I’ve been saying it for years but she still won’t go out with me —” 
“JORDAN!” yelled Professor McGonagall. 
“Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest — and she’s ducked 
Warrington, she’s passed Montague, she’s — ouch — been hit from 
behind by a Bludger from Crabbe. . . . Montague catches the Quaffle, 
Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from 
George Weasley, that’s a Bludger to the head for Montague, he drops 
the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse 
passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet’s away —” 
Lee Jordan’s commentary rang through the stadium and Harry lis-
tened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and 
the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing — 
“— dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger — close call, Alicia — 
and the crowd are loving this, just listen to them, what’s that they’re 
singing?” 
And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the 
sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands: 
 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 407  
Weasley cannot save a thing, 
He cannot block a single ring, 
That’s why Slytherins all sing: 
Weasley is our King. 
 
Weasley was born in a bin, 
He always lets the Quaffle in, 
Weasley will make sure we win, 
Weasley is our King. 
 
“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry 
swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee 
was trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now, 
Angelina — looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE 
SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah . . .” 
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the 
Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between 
Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he 
drew nearer and nearer Ron — 
 
Weasley is our King, 
Weasley is our King, 
He always lets the Quaffle in, 
Weasley is our King. 
 
Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, 
he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the 
pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive War-
rington pelted toward him . . . 
“— and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for 
goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead —” 
A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below: 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 408  
Weasley cannot save a thing, 
He cannot block a single ring . . . 
 
“— so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother 
of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the 
team — come on, Ron!” 
But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: Ron had 
dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between 
them, straight through Ron’s central hoop. 
“Slytherin score!” came Lee’s voice amid the cheering and booing 
from the crowds below. “So that’s ten-nil to Slytherin — bad luck, 
Ron . . .” 
The Slytherins sang even louder: 
 
WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN, 
HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN . . . 
 
“— and Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie Bell tanking 
up the pitch —” cried Lee valiantly, though the singing was now so 
deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it. 
 
WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN, 
WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . . 
 
“Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” screamed Angelina, soaring 
past him to keep up with Katie. “GET GOING!” 
Harry realized that he had been stationary in midair for more than 
a minute, watching the progress of the match without sparing a 
thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, he went into a 
dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ig-
nore the chorus now thundering through the stadium: 
 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 409  
WEASLEY IS OUR KING, 
WEASLEY IS OUR KING . . . 
 
There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked; Malfoy was 
still circling the stadium just like Harry. They passed midway around 
the pitch going in opposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy 
singing loudly, 
 
WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN . . . 
 
“— and it’s Warrington again,” bellowed Lee, “who passes to Pucey, 
Pucey’s off past Spinnet, come on now Angelina, you can take him — 
turns out you can’t — but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley, I mean, 
George Weasley, oh who cares, one of them anyway, and Warrington 
drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell — er — drops it too — so that’s 
Montague with the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Montague takes the 
Quaffle, and he’s off up the pitch, come on now Gryffindor, block him!” 
Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin 
goal hoops, willing himself not to look at what was going on at Ron’s 
end; as he sped past the Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing 
along with the crowd below, 
 
WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING . . . 
 
“— and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading straight for 
goal, stop it, Ron!” 
Harry did not have to look to see what had happened: There was a 
terrible groan from the Gryffindor end, coupled with fresh screams 
and applause from the Slytherins. Looking down, Harry saw the pug-
faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the 
pitch as she conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring: 
 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 410  
THAT’S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING: 
WEASLEY IS OUR KING. 
 
But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to 
catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead 
as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the 
other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be 
Montague’s watch strap. . . . 
But Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in 
Harry’s desire to find the Snitch now. If he could just get it soon and 
finish the game quickly . . . 
“— and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey, ducks Montague, 
nice swerve, Katie, and she throws to Johnson, Angelina Johnson 
takes the Quaffle, she’s past Warrington, she’s heading for goal, come 
on now Angelina — GRYFFINDOR SCORE! It’s forty-ten, forty-
ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle. . . .” 
Harry could hear Luna’s ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the 
Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened; only thirty points in it, that was 
nothing, they could pull back easily. Harry ducked a Bludger that 
Crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic 
scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping one eye on Malfoy in 
case he showed signs of having spotted it, but Malfoy, like him, was 
continuing to soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly . . . 
“— Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Mon-
tague back to Pucey — Johnson intervenes, Johnson takes the Quaf-
fle, Johnson to Bell, this looks good — I mean bad — Bell’s hit by a 
Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it’s Pucey in possession 
again . . .”

 411  
But Harry had seen it at last: The tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was 
hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch. 
He dived. . . . 
In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on 
Harry’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on his broom. . . . 
The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off 
toward the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited Mal-
foy, who was nearer. Harry pulled his Firebolt around, he and Malfoy 
were now neck and neck . . . 
Feet from the ground, Harry lifted his right hand from his broom, 
stretching toward the Snitch . . . to his right, Malfoy’s arm extended 
too, reaching, groping . . . 
It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds — 
Harry’s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball — Malfoy’s fin-
gernails scrabbled the back of Harry’s hand hopelessly — Harry 
pulled his broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his hand and 
the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval. . . . 
They were saved, it did not matter that Ron had let in those goals, 
nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won — 
WHAM! 
A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew 
forward off his broom; luckily he was only five or six feet above the 
ground, having dived so low to catch the Snitch, but he was winded 
all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch. He heard 
Madam Hooch’s shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded 
of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina’s frantic 
voice. 
“Are you all right?” 
“ ’Course I am,” said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing 
her to pull him to his feet. Madam Hooch was zooming toward one 
of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it 
was at this angle. 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 412  
“It was that thug, Crabbe,” said Angelina angrily. “He whacked the 
Bludger at you the moment he saw you’d got the Snitch — but we 
won, Harry, we won!” 
Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around, still 
holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close 
by; white-faced with fury, he was still managing to sneer. 
“Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you?” he said to Harry. “I’ve never 
seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was born in a bin. . . . Did you 
like my lyrics, Potter?” 
Harry did not answer; he turned away to meet the rest of the team 
who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in tri-
umph, all except Ron, who had dismounted from his broom over by 
the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing 
rooms alone. 
“We wanted to write another couple of verses!” Malfoy called, as 
Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. “But we couldn’t find rhymes for fat 
and ugly — we wanted to sing about his mother, see —” 
“Talk about sour grapes,” said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted 
look. 
“— we couldn’t fit in useless loser either — for his father, you 
know —” 
Fred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about. 
Halfway through shaking Harry’s hand they stiffened, looking around 
at Malfoy. 
“Leave it,” said Angelina at once, taking Fred by the arm. “Leave it, 
Fred, let him yell, he’s just sore he lost, the jumped-up little —” 
“— but you like the Weasleys, don’t you, Potter?” said Malfoy, 
sneering. “Spend holidays there and everything, don’t you? Can’t see 
how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you’ve been dragged up 
by Muggles even the Weasleys’ hovel smells okay —” 
Harry grabbed hold of George; meanwhile it was taking the com-
bined efforts of Angelina, Alicia, and Katie to stop Fred leaping on 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 413  
Malfoy, who was laughing openly. Harry looked around for Madam 
Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack. 
“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can re-
member what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s 
pigsty reminds you of it —” 
Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a 
second later both of them were sprinting at Malfoy. He had com-
pletely forgotten the fact that all the teachers were watching: All he 
wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible. With no 
time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the 
Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy’s stomach — 
“Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO !” 
He could hear girls’ voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George 
swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around 
him, but he did not care, not until somebody in the vicinity yelled 
“IMPEDIMENTA!” and only when he was knocked over backward by 
the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch 
of Malfoy he could reach. . . . 
“What do you think you’re doing?” screamed Madam Hooch, as 
Harry leapt to his feet again; it was she who had hit him with the Im-
pediment Jinx. She was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand 
in the other, her broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was 
curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; 
George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly re-
strained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the back-
ground. “I’ve never seen behavior like it — back up to the castle, both 
of you, and straight to your Head of House’s office! Go! Now!” 
Harry and George marched off the pitch, both panting, neither say-
ing a word to each other. The howling and jeering of the crowd grew 
fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall, where they 
could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps. Harry be-
came aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 414  
knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy’s jaw; looking down 
he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding from between his fingers, 
struggling for release. 
They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall’s office 
when she came marching along the corridor behind them. She was 
wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her throat with shaking 
hands as she strode toward them, looking livid. 
“In!” she said furiously, pointing to the door. Harry and George en-
tered. She strode around behind her desk and faced them, quivering 
with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside onto the floor. 
“Well ?” she said. “I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition. 
Two onto one! Explain yourselves!” 
“Malfoy provoked us,” said Harry stiffly. 
“Provoked you?” shouted Professor McGonagall, slamming a fist 
onto her desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off it and 
burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts. “He’d just lost, 
hadn’t he, of course he wanted to provoke you! But what on earth he 
can have said that justified what you two —” 
“He insulted my parents,” snarled George. “And Harry’s mother.” 
“But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two de-
cided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?” bellowed 
Professor McGonagall. “Have you any idea what you’ve — ?” 
“Hem, hem.” 
George and Harry both spun around. Dolores Umbridge was 
standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly 
enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad, and smiling in the horribly 
sickly, ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent 
misery. 
“May I help, Professor McGonagall?” asked Professor Umbridge in 
her most poisonously sweet voice. 
Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall’s face. 
 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 415  
“Help?” she repeated in a constricted voice. “What do you mean, 
‘help’?” 
Professor Umbridge moved forward into the office, still smiling her 
sickly smile. 
“Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority.” 
Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Profes-
sor McGonagall’s nostrils. 
“You thought wrong,” she said, turning her back on Umbridge. 
“Now, you two had better listen closely. I do not care what provoca-
tion Malfoy offered you, I do not care if he insulted every family 
member you possess, your behavior was disgusting and I am giving 
each of you a week’s worth of detention! Do not look at me like that, 
Potter, you deserve it! And if either of you ever —” 
“Hem, hem.” 
Professor McGonagall closed her eyes as though praying for pa-
tience as she turned her face toward Professor Umbridge again. 
“Yes?” 
“I think they deserve rather more than detentions,” said Umbridge, 
smiling still more broadly. 
Professor McGonagall’s eyes flew open. “But unfortunately,” she 
said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as 
though she had lockjaw, “it is what I think that counts, as they are in 
my House, Dolores.” 
“Well, actually, Minerva,” simpered Umbridge, “I think you’ll find 
that what I think does count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it. 
. . . I mean,” she gave a little false laugh as she rummaged in her hand-
bag, “the Minister just sent it. . . . Ah yes . . .” 
She had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled, 
clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said. 
“Hem, hem . . . ‘Educational Decree Number Twenty-five . . .’ ” 
“Not another one!” exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently. 
 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 416  
“Well, yes,” said Umbridge, still smiling. “As a matter of fact, Min-
erva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amend-
ment. . . . You remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling 
to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took 
the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to 
play? Well, now, I couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, 
and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the 
power to strip pupils of privileges, or she — that is to say, I — would 
have less authority than common teachers! And you see now, don’t 
you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor 
team re-forming? Dreadful tempers . . . Anyway, I was reading out our 
amendment . . . hem, hem . . . ‘The High Inquisitor will henceforth 
have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions, and removal 
of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to 
alter such punishments, sanctions, and removals of privileges as may 
have been ordered by other staff members. Signed, Cornelius Fudge, 
Minister of Magic, Order of Merlin First Class, etc., etc. . . .’ ” 
She rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag, still 
smiling. 
“So . . . I really think I will have to ban these two from playing 
Quidditch ever again,” she said, looking from Harry to George and 
back again. 
Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his hand. 
“Ban us?” he said, and his voice sounded strangely distant. “From 
playing . . . ever again?” 
“Yes, Mr. Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,” said 
Umbridge, her smile widening still further as she watched him strug-
gle to comprehend what she had said. “You and Mr. Weasley here. 
And I think, to be safe, this young man’s twin ought to be stopped 
too — if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would 
have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks 
confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to make 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 417  
sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable, 
Professor McGonagall,” she continued, turning back to Professor 
McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice, 
staring at her. “The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no 
signs of violence from any of them. Well . . . good afternoon to you.” 
And with a look of the utmost satisfaction Umbridge left the room, 
leaving a horrified silence in her wake. 
 
“Banned,” said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the 
common room. “Banned. No Seeker and no Beaters . . . What on 
earth are we going to do?” 
It did not feel as though they had won the match at all. Everywhere 
Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team them-
selves were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not 
been seen since the end of the match. 
“It’s just so unfair,” said Alicia numbly. “I mean, what about 
Crabbe and that Bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown? Has 
she banned him?” 
“No,” said Ginny miserably; she and Hermione were sitting on ei-
ther side of Harry. “He just got lines, I heard Montague laughing 
about it at dinner.” 
“And banning Fred when he didn’t even do anything!” said Alicia 
furiously, pummeling her knee with her fist. 
“It’s not my fault I didn’t,” said Fred, with a very ugly look on his 
face. “I would’ve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three 
hadn’t been holding me back.” 
Harry stared miserably at the dark window. Snow was falling. The 
Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the 
common room; people were watching its progress as though hyp-
notized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to 
catch it. 
“I’m going to bed,” said Angelina, getting slowly to her feet. 
CHAPTER  NINETEEN 
 418  
“Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream. . . . Maybe I’ll 
wake up tomorrow and find we haven’t played yet. . . .” 
She was soon followed by Alicia and Katie. Fred and George sloped 
off to bed some time later, glowering at everyone they passed, and 
Ginny went not long after that. Only Harry and Hermione were left 
beside the fire. 
“Have you seen Ron?” Hermione asked in a low voice. 
Harry shook his head. 
“I think he’s avoiding us,” said Hermione. “Where do you think 
he — ?” 
But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind 
them as the Fat Lady swung forward and Ron came clambering 
through the portrait hole. He was very pale indeed and there was 
snow in his hair. When he saw Harry and Hermione he stopped dead 
in his tracks. 
“Where have you been?” said Hermione anxiously, springing up. 
“Walking,” Ron mumbled. He was still wearing his Quidditch 
things. 
“You look frozen,” said Hermione. “Come and sit down!” 
Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from 
Harry’s, not looking at him. The stolen Snitch zoomed over their 
heads. 
“I’m sorry,” Ron mumbled, looking at his feet. 
“What for?” said Harry. 
“For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron. “I’m going to resign 
first thing tomorrow.” 
“If you resign,” said Harry testily, “there’ll only be three players left 
on the team.” And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, “I’ve been 
given a lifetime ban. So’ve Fred and George.” 
“What?” Ron yelped. 
Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it 
again. When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever. 
THE  LION  AND 
THE  SERPENT 
 419  
“This is all my fault —” 
“You didn’t make me punch Malfoy,” said Harry angrily. 
“— if I wasn’t so lousy at Quidditch —” 
“— it’s got nothing to do with that —” 
“— it was that song that wound me up —” 
“— it would’ve wound anyone up —” 
Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argu-
ment, watching the snow swirling down against the pane. 
“Look, drop it, will you!” Harry burst out. “It’s bad enough with-
out you blaming yourself for everything!” 
Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his 
robes. After a while he said in a dull voice, “This is the worst I’ve ever 
felt in my life.” 
“Join the club,” said Harry bitterly. 
“Well,” said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly. “I can think of 
one thing that might cheer you both up.” 
“Oh yeah?” said Harry skeptically. 
“Yeah,” said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-
flecked window, a broad smile spreading across her face. “Hagrid’s 
back.”

arry sprinted up to the boys’ dormitory to fetch the Invisi-
bility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map from his trunk; he was 
so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes be-
fore Hermione hurried back down from the girls’ dormitories, wear-
ing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats. 
“Well, it’s cold out there!” she said defensively, as Ron clicked his 
tongue impatiently. 
They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves 
hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so much he now needed to 
crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cau-
tiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals 
to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; 
they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along 
absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like 
“Weasley Is Our King.” They crept across the entrance hall and then 
out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, 
Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up 
from Hagrid’s chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two 
H

 421  
jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly 
through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden 
front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog 
started barking frantically inside. 
“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry called through the keyhole. 
“Shoulda known!” said a gruff voice. 
They beamed at one another under the cloak; they could tell that 
Hagrid’s voice was pleased. “Bin home three seconds . . . Out the way, 
Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . .” 
The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open, and Hagrid’s 
head appeared in the gap. 
Hermione screamed. 
“Merlin’s beard, keep it down!” said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly 
over their heads. “Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!” 
“I’m sorry!” Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past 
Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could 
see them. “I just — oh, Hagrid!” 
“It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’!” said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door 
behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione 
continued to gaze up at him in horror. 
Hagrid’s hair was matted with congealed blood, and his left eye had 
been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises. 
There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleed-
ing, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken 
ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black trav-
eling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough 
to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. 
Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as 
broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle 
over it. 
“What happened to you?” Harry demanded, while Fang danced 
around them all, trying to lick their faces. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 422  
“Told yeh, nuthin’,” said Hagrid firmly. “Want a cuppa?” 
“Come off it,” said Ron, “you’re in a right state!” 
“I’m tellin’ yeh, I’m fine,” said Hagrid, straightening up and turn-
ing to beam at them all, but wincing. “Blimey, it’s good ter see you 
three again — had good summers, did yeh?” 
“Hagrid, you’ve been attacked!” said Ron. 
“Fer the las’ time, it’s nuthin’!” said Hagrid firmly. 
“Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound 
of mince instead of a face?” Ron demanded. 
“You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,” said Hermi-
one anxiously. “Some of those cuts look nasty.” 
“I’m dealin’ with it, all righ’?” said Hagrid repressively. 
He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the 
middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying 
on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger 
than the average car tire. 
“You’re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?” said Ron, leaning 
in for a closer look. “It looks poisonous.” 
“It’s s’posed ter look like that, it’s dragon meat,” Hagrid said. “An’ I 
didn’ get it ter eat.” 
He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. 
Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of 
satisfaction. 
“Tha’s better. It helps with the stingin’, yeh know.” 
“So are you going to tell us what’s happened to you?” Harry asked. 
“Can’, Harry. Top secret. More’n me job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” 
“Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?” asked Hermione quietly. 
Hagrid’s fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily 
onto his chest. 
“Giants?” said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt 
and slapping it back over his face. “Who said anythin’ abou’ giants?  
 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 423  
Who yeh bin talkin’ to? Who’s told yeh what I’ve — who’s said I’ve 
bin — eh?” 
“We guessed,” said Hermione apologetically. 
“Oh, yeh did, did yeh?” said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye 
that was not hidden by the steak. 
“It was kind of . . . obvious,” said Ron. Harry nodded. 
Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table 
again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling. 
“Never known kids like you three fer knowin’ more’n yeh oughta,” 
he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped 
mugs. “An’ I’m not complimentin’ yeh, neither. Nosy, some’d call it. 
Interferin’.” 
But his beard twitched. 
“So you have been to look for giants?” said Harry, grinning as he sat 
down at the table. 
Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his 
steak again, and slapped it back over his face. 
“Yeah, all righ’,” he grunted, “I have.” 
“And you found them?” said Hermione in a hushed voice. 
“Well, they’re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,” said Hagrid. 
“Pretty big, see.” 
“Where are they?” said Ron. 
“Mountains,” said Hagrid unhelpfully. 
“So why don’t Muggles — ?” 
“They do,” said Hagrid darkly. “O’ny their deaths are always put 
down ter mountaineerin’ accidents, aren’ they?” 
He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the 
bruising. 
“Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you’ve been up to!” said Ron. “Tell 
us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about be-
ing attacked by the dementors —” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 424  
Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; 
a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the 
table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft 
splat, onto the floor. 
“Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?” growled Hagrid. 
“Didn’t you know?” Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. 
“I don’ know anything that’s been happenin’ since I left. I was on a 
secret mission, wasn’ I, didn’ wan’ owls followin’ me all over the 
place — ruddy dementors! Yeh’re not serious?” 
“Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my 
cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me —” 
“WHAT?” 
“— and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about 
the giants first.” 
“You were expelled?” 
“Tell us about your summer and I’ll tell you about mine.” 
Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right 
back, an expression of innocent determination on his face. 
“Oh, all righ’,” Hagrid said in a resigned voice. 
He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang’s mouth. 
“Oh, Hagrid, don’t, it’s not hygien —” Hermione began, but Ha-
grid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took 
another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, “Well, we set off righ’ af-
ter term ended —” 
“Madame Maxime went with you, then?” Hermione interjected. 
“Yeah, tha’s right,” said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared 
on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green 
steak. “Yeah, it was jus’ the pair of us. An’ I’ll tell yeh this, she’s not 
afraid of roughin’ it, Olympe. Yeh know, she’s a fine, well-dressed 
woman, an’ knowin’ where we was goin’ I wondered ’ow she’d feel 
abou’ clamberin’ over boulders an’ sleepin’ in caves an’ tha’, bu’ she 
never complained once.” 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 425  
“You knew where you were going?” Harry asked. “You knew where 
the giants were?” 
“Well, Dumbledore knew, an’ he told us,” said Hagrid. 
“Are they hidden?” asked Ron. “Is it a secret, where they are?” 
“Not really,” said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. “It’s jus’ that 
mos’ wizards aren’ bothered where they are, s’ long as it’s a good long 
way away. But where they are’s very difficult ter get ter, fer humans 
anyway, so we needed Dumbledore’s instructions. Took us abou’ a 
month ter get there —” 
“A month?” said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey 
lasting such a ridiculously long time. “But — why couldn’t you just 
grab a Portkey or something?” 
There was an odd expression in Hagrid’s unobscured eye as he 
squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying. 
“We’re bein’ watched, Ron,” he said gruffly. 
“What d’you mean?” 
“Yeh don’ understand,” said Hagrid. “The Ministry’s keepin’ an eye 
on Dumbledore an’ anyone they reckon’s in league with him, an’ —” 
“We know about that,” said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest 
of Hagrid’s story. “We know about the Ministry watching Dumble-
dore —” 
“So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked Ron, looking thun-
derstruck. “You had to act like Muggles all the way?” 
“Well, not exactly all the way,” said Hagrid cagily. “We jus’ had ter 
be careful, ’cause Olympe an’ me, we stick out a bit —” 
Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff 
and hastily took a gulp of tea. 
“— so we’re not hard ter follow. We was pretendin’ we was goin’ on 
holiday together, so we got inter France an’ we made like we was 
headin’ fer where Olympe’s school is, ’cause we knew we was bein’ 
tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, ’cause I’m 
not really s’posed ter use magic an’ we knew the Ministry’d be lookin’ 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 426  
fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin’ us 
the slip round abou’ Dee-John —” 
“Ooooh, Dijon?” said Hermione excitedly. “I’ve been there on hol-
iday, did you see — ?” 
She fell silent at the look on Ron’s face. 
“We chanced a bit o’ magic after that, and it wasn’ a bad journey. 
Ran inter a couple o’ mad trolls on the Polish border, an’ I had a sligh’ 
disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha’, 
couldn’t’a bin smoother. 
“An’ then we reached the place, an’ we started trekkin’ up through 
the mountains, lookin’ fer signs of ’em . . . 
“We had ter lay off the magic once we got near ’em. Partly ’cause they 
don’ like wizards an’ we didn’ want ter put their backs up too soon, and 
partly ’cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound 
ter be after the giants an’ all. Said it was odds on he’d sent a messenger 
off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin’ attention ter 
ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.” 
Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea. 
“Go on!” said Harry urgently. 
“Found ’em,” said Hagrid baldly. “Went over a ridge one nigh’ an’ 
there they was, spread ou’ underneath us. Little fires burnin’ below an’ 
huge shadows . . . It was like watchin’ bits o’ the mountain movin’.” 
“How big are they?” asked Ron in a hushed voice. 
“ ’Bout twenty feet,” said Hagrid casually. “Some o’ the bigger ones 
mighta bin twenty-five.” 
“And how many were there?” asked Harry. 
“I reckon abou’ seventy or eighty,” said Hagrid. 
“Is that all?” said Hermione. 
“Yep,” said Hagrid sadly, “eighty left, an’ there was loads once, 
musta bin a hundred diff’rent tribes from all over the world. But 
they’ve bin dyin’ out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o’ course, but  
 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 427  
mostly they killed each other, an’ now they’re dyin’ out faster than 
ever. They’re not made ter live bunched up together like tha’. Dumb-
ledore says it’s our fault, it was the wizards who forced ’em to go an’ 
made ’em live a good long way from us an’ they had no choice but ter 
stick together fer their own protection.” 
“So,” said Harry, “you saw them and then what?” 
“Well, we waited till morning, didn’ want ter go sneakin’ up on ’em 
in the dark, fer our own safety,” said Hagrid. “ ’Bout three in the 
mornin’ they fell asleep jus’ where they was sittin’. We didn’ dare sleep. 
Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of ’em woke up an’ 
came up where we were, an’ fer another, the snorin’ was unbelievable. 
Caused an avalanche near mornin’. 
“Anyway, once it was light we wen’ down ter see ’em.” 
“Just like that?” said Ron, looking awestruck. “You just walked 
right into a giant camp?” 
“Well, Dumbledore’d told us how ter do it,” said Hagrid. “Give the 
Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.” 
“Give the what gifts?” asked Harry. 
“Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.” 
“How could you tell which one was the Gurg?” asked Ron. 
Hagrid grunted in amusement. 
“No problem,” he said. “He was the biggest, the ugliest, an’ the 
laziest. Sittin’ there waitin’ ter be brought food by the others. Dead 
goats an’ such like. Name o’ Karkus. I’d put him at twenty-two, 
twenty-three feet, an’ the weight of a couple o’ bull elephants. Skin 
like rhino hide an’ all.” 
“And you just walked up to him?” said Hermione breathlessly. 
“Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin’ in the valley. They was 
in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a moun-
tain lake, an’ Karkus was lyin’ by the lake roarin’ at the others ter feed 
him an’ his wife. Olympe an’ I went down the mountainside —” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 428  
“But didn’t they try and kill you when they saw you?” asked Ron 
incredulously. 
“It was def’nitely on some of their minds,” said Hagrid, shrugging, 
“but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our 
gift up high an’ keep our eyes on the Gurg an’ ignore the others. So 
tha’s what we did. An’ the rest of ’em went quiet an’ watched us pass 
an’ we got right up ter Karkus’s feet an’ we bowed an’ put our present 
down in front o’ him.” 
“What do you give a giant?” asked Ron eagerly. “Food?” 
“Nah, he can get food all righ’ fer himself,” said Hagrid. “We took 
him magic. Giants like magic, jus’ don’t like us usin’ it against ’em. 
Anyway, that firs’ day we gave him a branch o’ Gubraithian fire.” 
Hermione said “wow” softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in 
puzzlement. 
“A branch of — ?” 
“Everlasting fire,” said Hermione irritably, “you ought to know that 
by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class!” 
“Well anyway,” said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could 
answer back, “Dumbledore’d bewitched this branch to burn ever-
more, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down 
in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants 
from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.’ ” 
“And what did Karkus say?” asked Harry eagerly. 
“Nothin’,” said Hagrid. “Didn’ speak English.” 
“You’re kidding!” 
“Didn’ matter,” said Hagrid imperturbably, “Dumbledore had 
warned us tha’ migh’ happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a cou-
ple o’ giants who knew our lingo an’ they translated fer us.” 
“And did he like the present?” asked Ron. 
“Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it 
was,” said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler  
 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 429  
side to his swollen eye. “Very pleased. So then I said, ‘Albus Dumble-
dore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns to-
morrow with another gift.’” 
“Why couldn’t you speak to them that day?” asked Hermione. 
“Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,” said Hagrid. “Let 
’em see we kept our promises. We’ll come back tomorrow with another 
present, an’ then we do come back with another present — gives a 
good impression, see? An’ gives them time ter test out the firs’ present 
an’ find out it’s a good one, an’ get ’em eager fer more. In any case, gi-
ants like Karkus — overload ’em with information an’ they’ll kill yeh 
jus’ to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an’ went off an’ 
found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an’ the fol-
lowin’ mornin’ we went back an’ this time we found Karkus sittin’ up 
waitin’ fer us lookin’ all eager.” 
“And you talked to him?” 
“Oh yeah. Firs’ we presented him with a nice battle helmet — 
goblin-made an’ indestructible, yeh know — an’ then we sat down an’ 
we talked.” 
“What did he say?” 
“Not much,” said Hagrid. “Listened mostly. But there were good 
signs. He’d heard o’ Dumbledore, heard he’d argued against the killin’ 
of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int’rested in 
what Dumbledore had ter say. An’ a few o’ the others, ’specially the 
ones who had some English, they gathered round an’ listened too. We 
were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day 
with another present. 
“But that night it all wen’ wrong.” 
“What d’you mean?” said Ron quickly. 
“Well, like I say, they’re not meant ter live together, giants,” said 
Hagrid sadly. “Not in big groups like that. They can’ help themselves, 
they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an’  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 430  
the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each 
other, an’ that’s even without squabbles over food an’ the best fires an’ 
sleepin’ spots. Yeh’d think, seein’ as how their whole race is abou’ fin-
ished, they’d lay off each other, but . . .” 
Hagrid sighed deeply 
“That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our 
cave, lookin’ down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn’ be-
lieve the noise. An’ when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an’ his 
head was lyin’ at the bottom o’ the lake.” 
“Whose head?” gasped Hermione. 
“Karkus’s,” said Hagrid heavily. “There was a new Gurg, Golgo-
math.” He sighed deeply. “Well, we hadn’ bargained on a new Gurg 
two days after we’d made friendly contact with the firs’ one, an’ we had 
a funny feelin’ Golgomath wouldn’ be so keen ter listen to us, but we 
had ter try.” 
“You went to speak to him?” asked Ron incredulously. “After you’d 
watched him rip off another giant’s head?” 
“ ’Course we did,” said Hagrid, “we hadn’ gone all that way ter give 
up after two days! We wen’ down with the next present we’d meant ter 
give ter Karkus. 
“I knew it was no go before I’d opened me mouth. He was sitting 
there wearin’ Karkus’s helmet, leerin’ at us as we got nearer. He’s mas-
sive, one o’ the biggest ones there. Black hair an’ matchin’ teeth an’ a 
necklace o’ bones. Human-lookin’ bones, some of ’em. Well, I gave it 
a go — held out a great roll o’ dragon skin — an’ said A gift fer the 
Gurg of the giants —’ Nex’ thing I knew, I was hangin’ upside down 
in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.” 
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth. 
“How did you get out of that?” asked Harry. 
“Wouldn’ta done if Olympe hadn’ bin there,” said Hagrid. “She 
pulled out her wand an’ did some o’ the fastes’ spellwork I’ve ever seen.

Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin’ me right in the eyes with Con-
junctivitus Curses an’ they dropped me straightaway — bu’ we were 
in trouble then, ’cause we’d used magic against ’em, an’ that’s what gi-
ants hate abou’ wizards. We had ter leg it an’ we knew there was no 
way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.” 
“Blimey, Hagrid,” said Ron quietly. 
“So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only 
there for three days?” asked Hermione. 
“We didn’ leave after three days!” said Hagrid, looking outraged. 
“Dumbledore was relyin’ on us!” 
“But you’ve just said there was no way you could go back!” 
“Not by daylight, we couldn’, no. We just had ter rethink a bit. 
Spent a couple o’ days lyin’ low up in the cave an’ watchin’. An’ wha’ 
we saw wasn’ good.” 
“Did he rip off more heads?” asked Hermione, sounding squeamish. 
“No,” said Hagrid. “I wish he had.” 
“What d’you mean?” 
“I mean we soon found out he didn’ object ter all wizards — just us.” 
“Death Eaters?” said Harry quickly. 
“Yep,” said Hagrid darkly. “Couple of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry 
day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an’ he wasn’ dangling them upside 
down.” 
“How d’you know they were Death Eaters?” said Ron. 
“Because I recognized one of ’em,” Hagrid growled. “Macnair, re-
member him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes 
killin’ as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin’ on so well.” 
“So Macnair’s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?” said 
Hermione desperately. 
“Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven’ finished me story yet!” said Hagrid 
indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them any-
thing in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. “Me  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 432  
an’ Olympe talked it over an’ we agreed, jus’ ’cause the Gurg looked 
like favorin’ You-Know-Who didn’ mean all of ’em would. We had ter 
try an’ persuade some o’ the others, the ones who hadn’ wanted Gol-
gomath as Gurg.” 
“How could you tell which ones they were?” asked Ron. 
“Well, they were the ones bein’ beaten to a pulp, weren’ they?” said 
Hagrid patiently. “The ones with any sense were keepin’ outta Golgo-
math’s way, hidin’ out in caves roun’ the gully jus’ like we were. So we 
decided we’d go pokin’ round the caves by night an’ see if we couldn’ 
persuade a few o’ them.” 
“You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?” said Ron 
with awed respect in his voice. 
“Well, it wasn’ the giants who worried us most,” said Hagrid. “We 
were more concerned abou’ the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us 
before we wen’ not ter tangle with ’em if we could avoid it, an’ the trou-
ble was they knew we was around — ’spect Golgomath told him abou’ 
us. At night when the giants were sleepin’ an’ we wanted ter be creepin’ 
inter the caves, Macnair an’ the other one were sneakin’ round the 
mountains lookin’ fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin’ out 
at them,” said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard. 
“She was rarin’ ter attack ’em. . . . she’s somethin’ when she’s roused, 
Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . ’spect it’s the French in her . . .” 
Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty 
seconds’ reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. 
“So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?” 
“What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after 
Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we’d bin hidin’ in and 
headed back down inter the gully, keepin’ our eyes skinned fer the 
Death Eaters. Got inside a few o’ the caves, no go — then, in abou’ 
the sixth one, we found three giants hidin’.” 
“Cave must’ve been cramped,” said Ron. 
 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 433  
“Wasn’ room ter swing a kneazle,” said Hagrid. 
“Didn’t they attack you when they saw you?” asked Hermione. 
“Probably woulda done if they’d bin in any condition,” said Ha-
grid, “but they was badly hurt, all three o’ them. Golgomath’s lot had 
beaten ’em unconscious; they’d woken up an’ crawled inter the near-
est shelter they could find. Anyway, one o’ them had a bit of English 
an’ ’e translated fer the others, an’ what we had ter say didn’ seem ter 
go down too badly. So we kep’ goin’ back, visitin’ the wounded. . . . I 
reckon we had abou’ six or seven o’ them convinced at one poin’.” 
“Six or seven?” said Ron eagerly. “Well that’s not bad — are they 
going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?” 
But Hermione said, “What do you mean ‘at one point,’ Hagrid?” 
Hagrid looked at her sadly. 
“Golgomath’s lot raided the caves. The ones tha’ survived didn’ 
wan’ no more ter to do with us after that.” 
“So . . . so there aren’t any giants coming?” said Ron, looking 
disappointed. 
“Nope,” said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his 
steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, “but we did wha’ we 
meant ter do, we gave ’em Dumbledore’s message an’ some o’ them 
heard it an’ I ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it. Jus’ maybe, them that 
don’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains, 
an’ there’s gotta be a chance they’ll remember Dumbledore’s friendly 
to ’em. . . . Could be they’ll come . . .” 
Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the 
knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his 
head in Harry’s lap. 
“Hagrid?” said Hermione quietly after a while. 
“Mmm?” 
“Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about 
your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 434  
Hagrid’s unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked 
rather scared. 
“I’m sorry . . . I . . . forget it —” 
“Dead,” Hagrid grunted. “Died years ago. They told me.” 
“Oh . . . I’m . . . I’m really sorry,” said Hermione in a very small 
voice. 
Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. “No need,” he said shortly. 
“Can’ remember her much. Wasn’ a great mother.” 
They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and 
Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. 
“But you still haven’t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,” 
Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid’s bloodstained face. 
“Or why you’re back so late,” said Harry. “Sirius says Madame 
Maxime got back ages ago —” 
“Who attacked you?” said Ron. 
“I haven’ bin attacked!” said Hagrid emphatically. “I —” 
But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of 
rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her 
fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared 
at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small 
and squat rippled across the thin curtain. 
“It’s her!” Ron whispered. 
“Get under here!” Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak 
he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the 
table and dived beneath the cloak as well. Huddled together they 
backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Ha-
grid looked thoroughly confused. 
“Hagrid, hide our mugs!” 
Hagrid seized Harry’s and Ron’s mugs and shoved them under 
the cushion in Fang’s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; 
Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. 
Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 435  
green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she 
leaned back so as to see Hagrid’s face; she barely reached his navel. 
“So,” she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody 
deaf. “You’re Hagrid, are you?” 
Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her 
bulging eyes rolling in every direction. 
“Get away,” she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had 
bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. 
“Er — I don’ want ter be rude,” said Hagrid, staring at her, “but 
who the ruddy hell are you?” 
“My name is Dolores Umbridge.” 
Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into 
the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Her-
mione. 
“Dolores Umbridge?” Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. 
“I thought you were one o’ them Ministry — don’ you work with 
Fudge?” 
“I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,” said Umbridge, 
now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from 
the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. “I am 
now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher —” 
“Tha’s brave of yeh,” said Hagrid, “there’s not many’d take tha’ job 
anymore —” 
“— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,” said Umbridge, giving no sign 
that she had heard him. 
“Wha’s that?” said Hagrid, frowning. 
“Precisely what I was going to ask,” said Umbridge, pointing at the 
broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione’s mug. 
“Oh,” said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner 
where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, “oh, tha’ was . . . was 
Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.” 
Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one

 436  
hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge 
stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead 
of the cabin’s. 
“I heard voices,” she said quietly. 
“I was talkin’ ter Fang,” said Hagrid stoutly. 
“And was he talking back to you?” 
“Well . . . in a manner o’ speakin’,” said Hagrid, looking uncom-
fortable. “I sometimes say Fang’s near enough human —” 
“There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the cas-
tle doors to your cabin,” said Umbridge sleekly. 
Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, 
Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge’s 
robes, and she did not appear to have heard. 
“Well, I on’y jus’ got back,” said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand 
at the haversack. “Maybe someone came ter call earlier an’ I missed 
em. 
“There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.” 
“Well I . . . I don’ know why that’d be. . . .” said Hagrid, tugging 
nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. 
“Erm . . .” 
Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin, 
looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She 
opened Hagrid’s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry ac-
tually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully 
inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled 
around again and said, “What has happened to you? How did you 
sustain those injuries?” 
Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in 
Harry’s opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising  
 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 437  
all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large 
amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. “Oh, I . . . had a bit 
of an accident,” he said lamely. 
“What sort of accident?” 
“I-I tripped.” 
“You tripped,” she repeated coolly. 
“Yeah, tha’s right. Over . . . over a friends broomstick. I don’ fly, 
meself. Well, look at the size o’ me, I don’ reckon there’s a broomstick 
that’d hold me. Friend o’ mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if 
you’ve ever seen ’em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I’ve had a bit of a 
ride on one o’ them an’ it was —” 
“Where have you been?” asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through 
Hagrid’s babbling. 
“Where’ve I . . . ?” 
“Been, yes,” she said. “Term started more than two months ago. 
Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues 
has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You 
left no address. Where have you been?” 
There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly un-
covered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously. 
“I — I’ve been away for me health,” he said. 
“For your health,” said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid’s 
discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his 
waistcoat in the silence. “I see.” 
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “bit o’ — o’ fresh air, yeh know —” 
“Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,” said 
Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid’s face that was not black 
or purple flushed. 
“Well — change o’ scene, yeh know —” 
“Mountain scenery?” said Umbridge swiftly. 
She knows, Harry thought desperately. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY 
 438  
“Mountains?” Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. “Nope, South 
of France fer me. Bit o’ sun an’ . . . an’ sea.” 
“Really?” said Umbridge. “You don’t have much of a tan.” 
“Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,” said Hagrid, attempting an in-
gratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked 
out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she 
hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, 
“I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.” 
“Righ’,” said Hagrid, nodding. 
“You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortu-
nate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we 
shall meet again soon enough.” 
She turned sharply and marched back to the door. 
“You’re inspectin’ us?” Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her. 
“Oh yes,” said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand 
on the door handle. “The Ministry is determined to weed out unsat-
isfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.” 
She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to 
pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist. 
“Not yet,” she breathed in his ear. “She might not be gone yet.” 
Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the 
room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so. 
“She’s goin’ back ter the castle,” he said in a low voice. “Blimey . . . 
inspectin’ people, is she?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling the cloak off. “Trelawney’s on probation 
already. . . .” 
“Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, 
Hagrid?” asked Hermione. 
“Oh, don’ you worry abou’ that, I’ve got a great load o’ lessons 
planned,” said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak 
from the table and slapping it over his eye again. “I’ve bin keepin’ a  
 
HAGRID’S  TALE 
 439  
couple o’ creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they’re some-
thin’ really special.” 
“Erm . . . special in what way?” asked Hermione tentatively. 
“I’m not sayin’,” said Hagrid happily. “I don’ want ter spoil the 
surprise.” 
“Look, Hagrid,” said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, 
“Professor Umbridge won’t be at all happy if you bring anything to 
class that’s too dangerous —” 
“Dangerous?” said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. “Don’ be 
silly, I wouldn’ give yeh anythin’ dangerous! I mean, all righ’, they can 
look after themselves —” 
“Hagrid, you’ve got to pass Umbridge’s inspection, and to do that 
it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after 
porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, 
stuff like that!” said Hermione earnestly. 
“But tha’s not very interestin’, Hermione,” said Hagrid. “The stuff 
I’ve got’s much more impressive, I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I 
reckon I’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain —” 
“Hagrid . . . please . . .” said Hermione, a note of real desperation 
in her voice. “Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teach-
ers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us 
something dull that’s bound to come up in our O.W.L. . . .” 
But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of 
longing toward the vast bed in the corner. 
“Lis’en, it’s bin a long day an’ it’s late,” he said, patting Hermione 
gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor 
with a thud. “Oh — sorry —” He pulled her back up by the neck of 
her robes. “Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve 
got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I’m back. . . . Now 
you lot had better get back up to the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe 
yer footprints out behind yeh!”

“I dunno if you got through to him,” said Ron a short while later 
when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to 
the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them 
due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they 
went. 
“Then I’ll go back again tomorrow,” said Hermione determinedly. 
“I’ll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don’t care if she throws out 
Trelawney but she’s not taking Hagrid!”

ermione plowed her way back to Hagrid’s cabin through two 
feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to 
go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarm-
ing height again, so they grudgingly remained in the common room, 
trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds out-
side, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen 
lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up 
to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows. 
“Oy!” bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head 
out of the window, “I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this 
window — OUCH!” 
He withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow. 
“It’s Fred and George,” he said bitterly, slamming the window be-
hind him. “Gits . . .” 
Hermione returned from Hagrid’s just before lunch, shivering 
slightly, her robes damp to the knees. 
“So?” said Ron, looking up when she entered. “Got all his lessons 
planned for him?” 
H 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 442  
“Well, I tried,” she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She 
pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot 
air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which 
began to steam as they dried out. “He wasn’t even there when I ar-
rived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came 
stumping out of the forest —” 
Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of 
creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. “What’s he keeping in 
there? Did he say?” asked Harry. 
“No,” said Hermione miserably. “He says he wants them to be a 
surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn’t get it. 
He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls 
than chimaeras — oh I don’t think he’s got a chimaera,” she added at 
the appalled look on Harry and Ron’s faces, “but that’s not for lack of 
trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. . . . I don’t 
know how many times I told him he’d be better off following 
Grubbly-Plank’s plan, I honestly don’t think he listened to half of 
what I said. He’s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won’t 
say how he got all those injuries. . . .” 
Hagrid’s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was 
not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George, 
and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the 
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid’s enormous hand; 
others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook 
their heads. Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor 
Grubbly-Plank’s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, un-
biased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank’s 
idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that 
somebody might have their head ripped off. 
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione headed down to Hagrid’s on Tuesday, heavily muffled 
against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 443  
might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the 
class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge 
was watching them. 
However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they strug-
gled through the snow toward Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on 
the edge of the forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the 
bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with 
green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding. 
Harry could not understand this: Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked 
by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from 
healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was 
carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder. 
“We’re workin’ in here today!” Hagrid called happily to the ap-
proaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind 
him. “Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark. . . .” 
“What prefers the dark?” Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to 
Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. “What did he say 
prefers the dark — did you hear?” 
Harry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered 
the forest before now; he had not been very brave then either. He 
smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused 
Malfoy discomfort was all right with him. 
“Ready?” said Hagrid happily, looking around at the class. “Right, 
well, I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year. Thought 
we’d go an’ see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what 
we’re studyin’ today is pretty rare, I reckon I’m probably the on’y per-
son in Britain who’s managed ter train ’em —” 
“And you’re sure they’re trained, are you?” said Malfoy, the panic in 
his voice even more pronounced now. “Only it wouldn’t be the first 
time you’d brought wild stuff to class, would it?” 
The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked 
as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point too. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 444  
“ ’Course they’re trained,” said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the 
dead cow a little higher on his shoulder. 
“So what happened to your face, then?” demanded Malfoy. 
“Mind yer own business!” said Hagrid, angrily. “Now if yeh’ve fin-
ished askin’ stupid questions, follow me!” 
He turned and strode straight into the forest. Nobody seemed 
much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who 
sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading 
the rest of the class. 
They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place 
where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight 
and there was no snow on the ground at all. Hagrid deposited his half 
a cow with a grunt on the ground, stepped back, and turned to face 
his class again, most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to 
tree, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at 
any moment. 
“Gather roun’, gather roun’,” said Hagrid encouragingly. “Now, 
they’ll be attracted by the smell o’ the meat but I’m goin’ ter give ’em 
a call anyway, ’cause they’ll like ter know it’s me. . . .” 
He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face, 
and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like 
the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed; most of them 
looked too scared to make a sound. 
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the 
class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around 
trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then, 
as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enor-
mous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space be-
tween two gnarled yew trees. 
A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through 
the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck, and then 
skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the dark-
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 445  
ness. It looked around at the class for a few seconds, swishing its long 
black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead 
cow with its pointed fangs. 
A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that 
he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew 
about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring 
around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why 
doesn’t Hagrid call again?” 
Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused 
and nervously expectant as Ron’s and were still gazing everywhere but 
at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other peo-
ple who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing 
just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of 
great distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the 
swishing progress of the long black tail. 
“Oh, an’ here comes another one!” said Hagrid proudly, as a second 
black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery wings 
closer to its body, and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. “Now . . . 
put yer hands up, who can see ’em?” 
Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the 
mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him. 
“Yeah . . . yeah, I knew you’d be able ter, Harry,” he said seriously. 
“An’ you too, Neville, eh? An’ —” 
“Excuse me,” said Malfoy in a sneering voice, “but what exactly are 
we supposed to be seeing?” 
For answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The 
whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped 
and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: Bits of flesh stripping 
themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to 
look very odd indeed. 
“What’s doing it?” Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating 
behind the nearest tree. “What’s eating it?” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 446  
“Thestrals,” said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft “oh!” of 
comprehension at Harry’s shoulder. “Hogwarts has got a whole herd 
of ’em in here. Now, who knows — ?” 
“But they’re really, really unlucky!” interrupted Parvati, looking 
alarmed. “They’re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune 
on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once —” 
“No, no, no,” said Hagrid, chuckling, “tha’s jus’ superstition, that 
is, they aren’ unlucky, they’re dead clever an’ useful! ’Course, this lot 
don’ get a lot o’ work, it’s mainly jus’ pullin’ the school carriages un-
less Dumbledore’s takin’ a long journey an’ don’ want ter Apparate — 
an’ here’s another couple, look —” 
Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing 
very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the 
tree, saying, “I think I felt something, I think it’s near me!” 
“Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh,” said Hagrid patiently. “Righ’, now, 
who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?” 
Hermione raised her hand. 
“Go on then,” said Hagrid, beaming at her. 
“The only people who can see thestrals,” she said, “are people who 
have seen death.” 
“Tha’s exactly right,” said Hagrid solemnly, “ten points ter Gryffin-
dor. Now, thestrals —” 
“Hem, hem.” 
Professor Umbridge had arrived. She was standing a few feet away 
from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at 
the ready. Hagrid, who had never heard Umbridge’s fake cough be-
fore, was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral, evidently un-
der the impression that it had made the sound. 
“Hem, hem.” 
“Oh hello!” Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the 
noise. 
“You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?” said 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 447  
Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier, 
as though she was addressing somebody both foreign and very slow. 
“Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson?” 
“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid brightly. “Glad yeh found the place all 
righ’! Well, as you can see — or, I dunno — can you? We’re doin’ 
thestrals today —” 
“I’m sorry?” said Umbridge loudly, cupping her hand around her 
ear and frowning. “What did you say?” 
Hagrid looked a little confused. 
“Er — thestrals!” he said loudly. “Big — er — winged horses, yeh 
know!” 
He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised 
her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard, 
“ ‘has . . . to . . . resort . . . to . . . crude . . . sign . . . language . . .’” 
“Well . . . anyway . . .” said Hagrid, turning back to the class and 
looking slightly flustered. “Erm . . . what was I sayin’?” 
“ ‘Appears . . . to . . . have . . . poor . . . short . . . term . . . memory . . .’ ” 
muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco 
Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early; Hermi-
one, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage. 
“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge’s 
clipboard, but plowing on valiantly. “Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how 
come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an’ five fe-
males. This one,” he patted the first horse to have appeared, “name o’ 
Tenebrus, he’s my special favorite, firs’ one born here in the forest —” 
“Are you aware,” Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, “that the 
Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ‘dangerous’?” 
Harry’s heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled. 
“Thestrals aren’ dangerous! All righ, they might take a bite outta 
you if yeh really annoy them —” 
“ ‘Shows . . . signs . . . of . . . pleasure . . . at . . . idea . . . of . . . vio-
lence . . . ’ ” muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 448  
“No — come on!” said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. “I 
mean, a dog’ll bite if yeh bait it, won’ it — but thestrals have jus’ got 
a bad reputation because o’ the death thing — people used ter think 
they were bad omens, didn’ they? Jus’ didn’ understand, did they?” 
Umbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then 
looked up at Hagrid and said, again very loudly and slowly, “Please 
continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk” — she mimed walk-
ing — Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter 
— “among the students” — she pointed around at individual mem-
bers of the class — “and ask them questions.” She pointed at her 
mouth to indicate talking. 
Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why 
she was acting as though he did not understand normal English. 
Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now. 
“You hag, you evil hag!” she whispered, as Umbridge walked to-
ward Pansy Parkinson. “I know what you’re doing, you awful, twisted, 
vicious —” 
“Erm . . . anyway,” said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the 
flow of his lesson, “so — thestrals. Yeah. Well, there’s loads o’ good 
stuff abou’ them. . . .” 
“Do you find,” said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy 
Parkinson, “that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he 
talks?” 
Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears 
of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was 
trying to suppress her giggles. “No . . . because . . . well . . . it sounds 
. . . like grunting a lot of the time. . . .” 
Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of 
Hagrid’s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard 
Pansy’s answer. 
“Er . . . yeah . . . good stuff abou’ thestrals. Well, once they’re 
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 449  
 tamed, like this lot, yeh’ll never be lost again. ‘Mazin’ senses o’ direc-
tion, jus’ tell ’em where yeh want ter go —” 
“Assuming they can understand you, of course,” said Malfoy 
loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Pro-
fessor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to 
Neville. 
“You can see the thestrals, Longbottom, can you?” she said. 
Neville nodded. 
“Whom did you see die?” she asked, her tone indifferent. 
“My . . . my grandad,” said Neville. 
“And what do you think of them?” she said, waving her stubby 
hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the car-
cass down to bone. 
“Erm,” said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. “Well, 
they’re . . . er . . . okay. . . .” 
“ ‘Students . . . are . . . too . . . intimidated . . . to . . . admit . . . they 
. . . are . . . frightened. . . .’ ” muttered Umbridge, making another 
note on her clipboard. 
“No!” said Neville, looking upset, “no, I’m not scared of them — !” 
“It’s quite all right,” said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoul-
der with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile, 
though it looked more like a leer to Harry. “Well, Hagrid,” she turned 
to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, 
“I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with. . . . You will re-
ceive” — she mimed taking something from the air in front of her — 
“the results of your inspection” — she pointed at the clipboard — “in 
ten days’ time.” She held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile 
wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat, she 
bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits 
of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury, and Neville looking 
confused and upset. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 450  
“That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!” stormed Hermione half 
an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the 
channels they had made earlier in the snow. “You see what she’s up to? 
It’s her thing about half-breeds all over again — she’s trying to make 
out Hagrid’s some kind of dim-witted troll, just because he had a gi-
antess for a mother — and oh, it’s not fair, that really wasn’t a bad les-
son at all — I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts 
again, but thestrals are fine — in fact, for Hagrid, they’re really good!” 
“Umbridge said they’re dangerous,” said Ron. 
“Well, it’s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,” said 
Hermione impatiently, “and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank 
wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level, but, well, 
they are very interesting, aren’t they? The way some people can see 
them and some can’t! I wish I could.” 
“Do you?” Harry asked her quietly. 
She looked horrorstruck. 
“Oh Harry — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that was a re-
ally stupid thing to say —” 
“It’s okay,” he said quickly, “don’t worry. . . .” 
“I’m surprised so many people could see them,” said Ron. “Three in 
a class —” 
“Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,” said a malicious voice 
nearby. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, 
Crabbe, and Goyle were walking along right behind them. “D’you 
reckon if you saw someone snuff it you’d be able to see the Quaffle 
better?” 
He, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on 
their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of “Weasley Is 
Our King.” Ron’s ears turned scarlet. 
“Ignore them, just ignore them,” intoned Hermione, pulling out 
her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that  
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 451  
she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow be-
tween them and the greenhouses. 
 
December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive 
avalanche of homework for the fifth years. Ron and Hermione’s pre-
fect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas ap-
proached. They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the 
castle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end 
and is trying to strangle you with it,” said Ron), to watch over first 
and second years spending their break times inside because of the bit-
ter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely 
weren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said Ron), and to patrol 
the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holi-
day spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got 
dung for brains, that one,” said Ron furiously). They were so busy that 
Hermione had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was 
down to her last three. 
“All those poor elves I haven’t set free yet, having to stay over dur-
ing Christmas because there aren’t enough hats!” 
Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking 
everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In 
any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time 
in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away 
from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether 
or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resent-
ful toward the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked 
forward to were the D.A. meetings, and they would have to stop over 
the holidays, as nearly everybody in the D.A. would be spending the 
time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents, 
something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of 
Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 452  
mountains. Ron, meanwhile, was going home to the Burrow. Harry 
endured several days of jealousy before Ron said, in response to Harry 
asking how Ron was going to get home for Christmas, “But you’re 
coming too! Didn’t I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks 
ago! 
Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry’s spirits soared: The thought 
of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful, only slightly marred 
by Harry’s guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holi-
day with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade 
Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart 
from the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sir-
ius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs. 
Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sir-
ius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, 
and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch 
it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think 
of Sirius alone in his mother’s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely 
cracker with Kreacher. 
Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A. 
meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when 
the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon him-
self to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done 
it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles 
from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry’s face and bearing 
the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS! 
Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before 
the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking dreamy 
as always. 
“Hello,” she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the 
decorations. “These are nice, did you put them up?” 
“No,” said Harry, “it was Dobby the house-elf.” 
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 453  
“Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white 
berries placed almost over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under 
it. “Good thinking,” said Luna very seriously. “It’s often infested with 
nargles.” 
Harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the 
arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of them were breath-
less and looked very cold. 
“Well,” said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it 
into a corner, “we’ve replaced you.” 
“Replaced me?” said Harry blankly. 
“You and Fred and George,” she said impatiently. “We’ve got an-
other Seeker!” 
“Who?” said Harry quickly. 
“Ginny Weasley,” said Katie. 
Harry gaped at her. 
“Yeah, I know,” said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her 
arm. “But she’s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,” she 
said, throwing him a very dirty look, “but as we can’t have you . . .” 
Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: Did she imagine 
for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hun-
dred times more than she did? 
“And what about the Beaters?” he asked, trying to keep his voice 
even. 
“Andrew Kirke,” said Alicia without enthusiasm, “and Jack Sloper. 
Neither of them are brilliant, but compared with the rest of the idiots 
who turned up . . .” 
The arrival of Ron, Hermione, and Neville brought this depressing 
discussion to an end and within five minutes, the room was full 
enough to prevent him seeing Angelina’s burning, reproachful looks. 
“Okay,” he said, calling them all to order. “I thought this evening 
we should just go over the things we’ve done so far, because it’s the last

meeting before the holidays and there’s no point starting anything 
new right before a three-week break —” 
“We’re not doing anything new?” said Zacharias Smith, in a dis-
gruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. “If I’d 
known that, I wouldn’t have come. . . .” 
“We’re all really sorry Harry didn’t tell you, then,” said Fred loudly. 
Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the fa-
miliar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a 
step going downstairs. 
“We can practice in pairs,” said Harry. “We’ll start with the Im-
pediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions 
and try Stunning again.” 
They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. 
The room was soon full of intermittent cries of “Impedimenta!” People 
froze for a minute or so, during which their partners would stare 
aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would 
unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx. 
Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when 
Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and 
Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the 
others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temp-
tation to walk past her several more times. 
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions 
all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again. Space was 
really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the 
group observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt 
himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True, 
Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been 
aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else 
had made enormous progress. 
At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt. 
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 455  
“You’re getting really good,” he said, beaming around at them. 
“When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the 
big stuff — maybe even Patronuses.” 
There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the 
usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas 
as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron 
and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left 
before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he 
was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from her. 
“No, you go on,” he heard her say to her friend Marietta, and his 
heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam’s 
apple. 
He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite 
sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he 
heard a hearty sniff. 
He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears 
pouring down her face. 
“Wha — ?” 
He didn’t know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying 
silently. 
“What’s up?” he said feebly. 
She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve. “I’m — 
sorry,” she said thickly. “I suppose . . . it’s just . . . learning all this 
stuff. . . . It just makes me . . . wonder whether . . . if he’d known it all 
. . . he’d still be alive. . . .” 
Harry’s heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled some-
where around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk 
about Cedric. 
“He did know this stuff,” Harry said heavily. “He was really good 
at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if 
Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don’t stand a chance.” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 456  
She hiccuped at the sound of Voldemort’s name, but stared at 
Harry without flinching. 
“You survived when you were just a baby,” she said quietly. 
“Yeah, well,” said Harry wearily, moving toward the door, “I dunno 
why, nor does anyone else, so it’s nothing to be proud of.” 
“Oh don’t go!” said Cho, sounding tearful again. “I’m really sorry 
to get all upset like this. . . . I didn’t mean to. . . .” 
She hiccuped again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were 
red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He’d have been so 
pleased just with a Merry Christmas. . . . 
“I know it must be horrible for you,” she said, mopping her eyes on 
her sleeve again. “Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die. . . . 
I suppose you just want to forget about it. . . .” 
Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt 
heartless saying it. 
“You’re a r-really good teacher, you know,” said Cho, with a watery 
smile. “I’ve never been able to Stun anything before.” 
“Thanks,” said Harry awkwardly. 
They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning 
desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inabil-
ity to move his feet. 
“Mistletoe,” said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head. 
“Yeah,” said Harry. His mouth was very dry. “It’s probably full of 
nargles, though.” 
“What are nargles?” 
“No idea,” said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to 
have been Stunned. “You’d have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.” 
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She 
was even nearer him now. He could have counted the freckles on her 
nose. 
“I really like you, Harry.” 
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 457  
He could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading throughout 
him, paralyzing his arms, legs, and brain. 
She was much too close. He could see every tear clinging to her 
eyelashes. . . . 
 
He returned to the common room half an hour later to find 
Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else 
had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; she had al-
ready filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the 
edge of the table. Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his 
Transfiguration homework. 
“What kept you?” he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next 
to Hermione’s. 
Harry did not answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him 
wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the 
other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave. 
“Are you all right, Harry?” Hermione asked, peering at him over 
the tip of her quill. 
Harry gave a halfhearted shrug. In truth, he didn’t know whether 
he was all right or not. “What’s up?” said Ron, hoisting himself up on 
his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. “What’s happened?” 
Harry didn’t quite know how to set about telling them, and still 
wasn’t sure whether he wanted to. Just as he had decided not to say 
anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands. 
“Is it Cho?” she asked in a businesslike way. “Did she corner you af-
ter the meeting?” 
Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off 
when Hermione caught his eye. 
“So — er — what did she want?” he asked in a mock casual voice. 
“She —” Harry began, rather hoarsely; he cleared his throat and 
tried again. “She — er —” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 458  
“Did you kiss?” asked Hermione briskly. 
Ron sat up so fast that he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug. 
Disregarding this completely he stared avidly at Harry. 
“Well?” he demanded. 
Harry looked from Ron’s expression of mingled curiosity and hilar-
ity to Hermione’s slight frown, and nodded. 
“HA!” 
Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a rau-
cous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second years 
over beside the window jump. A reluctant grin spread over Harry’s 
face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug. Hermione 
gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter. 
“Well?” Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. “How was it?” 
Harry considered for a moment. 
“Wet,” he said truthfully. 
Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, 
it was hard to tell. 
“Because she was crying,” Harry continued heavily. 
“Oh,” said Ron, his smile fading slightly. “Are you that bad at 
kissing?” 
“Dunno,” said Harry, who hadn’t considered this, and immediately 
felt rather worried. “Maybe I am.” 
“Of course you’re not,” said Hermione absently, still scribbling 
away at her letter. 
“How do you know?” said Ron in a sharp voice. 
“Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,” said Her-
mione vaguely. “She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the 
place.” 
“You’d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,” said Ron, 
grinning. 
“Ron,” said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her  
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 459  
quill into her ink pot, “you are the most insensitive wart I have ever 
had the misfortune to meet.” 
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Ron indignantly. “What sort 
of person cries while someone’s kissing them?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, slightly desperately, “who does?” 
Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying ex-
pression on her face. 
“Don’t you understand how Cho’s feeling at the moment?” she 
asked. 
“No,” said Harry and Ron together. 
Hermione sighed and laid down her quill. 
“Well, obviously, she’s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. 
Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now 
she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best. Then she’ll 
be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kiss-
ing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else 
might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she prob-
ably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, be-
cause he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s 
all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she’s afraid she’s going to be 
thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she’s been flying so 
badly.” 
A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron 
said, “One person can’t feel all that at once, they’d explode.” 
“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t 
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again. 
“She was the one who started it,” said Harry. “I wouldn’t’ve — she 
just sort of came at me — and next thing she’s crying all over me — I 
didn’t know what to do —” 
“Don’t blame you, mate,” said Ron, looking alarmed at the very 
thought. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 460  
“You just had to be nice to her,” said Hermione, looking up anx-
iously. “You were, weren’t you?” 
“Well,” said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, “I sort 
of — patted her on the back a bit.” 
Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling 
her eyes with extreme difficulty. 
“Well, I suppose it could have been worse,” she said. “Are you go-
ing to see her again?” 
“I’ll have to, won’t I?” said Harry. “We’ve got D.A. meetings, 
haven’t we?” 
“You know what I mean,” said Hermione impatiently. 
Harry said nothing. Hermione’s words opened up a whole new 
vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going somewhere 
with Cho — Hogsmeade, perhaps — and being alone with her for 
hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask 
her out after what had just happened. . . . The thought made his 
stomach clench painfully. 
“Oh well,” said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, 
“you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her. . . .” 
“What if he doesn’t want to ask her?” said Ron, who had been 
watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face. 
“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione vaguely, “Harry’s liked her for ages, 
haven’t you, Harry?” 
He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he 
had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured 
a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sob-
bing uncontrollably into his shoulder. 
“Who’re you writing the novel to anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, 
trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor. 
Hermione hitched it up out of sight. 
“Viktor.” 
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 461  
“Krum?” 
“How many other Viktors do we know?” 
Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for 
another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with 
many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing 
steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and 
sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything 
that Sirius’s head would appear there and give him some advice about 
girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot 
embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they 
were, yet again, the last in the common room. 
“Well, ’night,” said Hermione, yawning widely, and she set off up 
the girls’ staircase. 
“What does she see in Krum?” Ron demanded as he and Harry 
climbed the boys’ stairs. 
“Well,” said Harry, considering the matter, “I s’pose he’s older, isn’t 
he . . . and he’s an international Quidditch player. . . .” 
“Yeah, but apart from that,” said Ron, sounding aggravated. “I 
mean he’s a grouchy git, isn’t he?” 
“Bit grouchy, yeah,” said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho. 
They pulled off their robes and put on pajamas in silence; Dean, 
Seamus, and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his 
bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed 
around his four-poster; instead he stared at the patch of starry sky vis-
ible through the window next to Neville’s bed. If he had known, this 
time last night, that in twenty-four hours’ time he would have kissed 
Cho Chang . . . 
“ ’Night,” grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right. 
“ ’Night,” said Harry. 
Maybe next time . . . if there was a next time . . . she’d be a bit 
happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 462  
expecting it and was now really angry with him . . . or was she lying in 
bed, still crying about Cedric? He did not know what to think. 
Hermione’s explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather 
than easier to understand. 
That’s what they should teach us here, he thought, turning over onto 
his side, how girls’ brains work . . . it’d be more useful than Divination 
anyway. . . . 
Neville snuffled in his sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the 
night. 
Harry dreamed he was back in the D.A. room. Cho was accusing 
him of luring her there under false pretenses; she said that he had 
promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog cards if she showed 
up. Harry protested. . . . Cho shouted, “Cedric gave me loads of Choco-
late Frog cards, look !” And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside 
her robes and threw them into the air, and then turned into 
Hermione, who said, “You did promise her, you know, Harry. . . . I  
think you’d better give her something else instead. . . . How about your  
Firebolt?” And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his 
Firebolt because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was 
ridiculous, he’d only come to the D.A. room to put up some Christ-
mas baubles shaped like Dobby’s head. . . . 
The dream changed. . . . 
His body felt smooth, powerful, and flexible. He was gliding be-
tween shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone. . . . He was flat 
against the floor, sliding along on his belly. . . . It was dark, yet he 
could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colors. 
. . . He was turning his head. . . . At first glance, the corridor was 
empty . . . but no . . . a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin 
drooping onto his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark. . . . 
Harry put out his tongue. . . . He tasted the man’s scent on the air. 
. . . He was alive but drowsing . . . sitting in front of a door at the end 
of the corridor . . . 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 463  
Harry longed to bite the man . . . but he must master the impulse. 
. . . He had more important work to do. . . . 
But the man was stirring . . . a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he 
jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline tower-
ing above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt. . . . He had no 
choice. . . . He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, 
three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man’s flesh, feeling his 
ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood. . . . 
The man was yelling in pain . . . then he fell silent. . . . He slumped 
backward against the wall. . . . Blood was splattering onto the floor. . . . 
His forehead hurt terribly. . . . It was aching fit to burst. . . . 
“Harry! HARRY!” 
He opened his eyes. Every inch of his body was covered in icy 
sweat; his bedcovers were twisted all around him like a straitjacket; he 
felt as though a white-hot poker was being applied to his forehead. 
“Harry!” 
Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened. There 
were more figures at the foot of Harry’s bed. He clutched his head in 
his hands; the pain was blinding him. . . . He rolled right over and 
vomited over the edge of the mattress. 
“He’s really ill,” said a scared voice. “Should we call someone?” 
“Harry! Harry!” 
He had to tell Ron, it was very important that he tell him. . . . Tak-
ing great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself 
not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him. 
“Your dad,” he panted, his chest heaving. “Your dad’s . . . been 
attacked. . . .” 
“What?” said Ron uncomprehendingly. 
“Your dad! He’s been bitten, it’s serious, there was blood 
everywhere. . . .” 
“I’m going for help,” said the same scared voice, and Harry heard 
footsteps running out of the dormitory. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE 
 464  
“Harry, mate,” said Ron uncertainly, “you . . . you were just 
dreaming. . . .” 
“No!” said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand. “It 
wasn’t a dream . . . not an ordinary dream. . . . I was there, I saw it. 
. . . I did  it. . . .” 
He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The 
pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly, though he was still sweat-
ing and shivering feverishly. He retched again and Ron leapt backward 
out of the way. 
“Harry, you’re not well,” he said shakily. “Neville’s gone for 
help. . . .” 
“I’m fine!” Harry choked, wiping his mouth on his pajamas and 
shaking uncontrollably. “There’s nothing wrong with me, it’s your dad 
you’ve got to worry about — we need to find out where he is — he’s 
bleeding like mad — I was — it was a huge snake. . . .” 
He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean 
and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one 
minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he simply sat there shak-
ing, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar. . . . Then there 
were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs, and he heard Neville’s 
voice again. 
“Over here, Professor . . .” 
Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tar-
tan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her 
bony nose. 
“What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?” 
He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Or-
der of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and 
prescribing useless potions. 
“It’s Ron’s dad,” he said, sitting up again. “He’s been attacked by a 
snake and it’s serious, I saw it happen.” 
 
THE  EYE  OF  THE  SNAKE 
 465  
“What do you mean, you saw it happen?” said Professor McGona-
gall, her dark eyebrows contracting. 
“I don’t know. . . . I was asleep and then I was there. . . .” 
“You mean you dreamed this?” 
“No!” said Harry angrily. Would none of them understand? “I was 
having a dream at first about something completely different, some-
thing stupid . . . and then this interrupted it. It was real, I didn’t imag-
ine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a 
gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone’s got 
to find out where he is. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided 
spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing. 
“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” Harry told her, his voice rising to 
a shout. “I tell you, I saw it happen!” 
“I believe you, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall curtly. “Put on 
your dressing-gown — we’re going to see the headmaster.”

arry was so relieved that she was taking him seriously that he 
did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on 
his dressing gown, and pushed his glasses back onto his nose. 
“Weasley, you ought to come too,” said Professor McGonagall. 
They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of 
Neville, Dean, and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral 
stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole, and off along 
the Fat Lady’s moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside 
him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for 
Dumbledore. Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so se-
dately, and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think “my 
fangs”) had been poisonous? They passed Mrs. Norris, who turned her 
lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but Professor McGona-
gall said, “Shoo!” Mrs. Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a 
few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the en-
trance to Dumbledore’s office. 
“Fizzing Whizbee,” said Professor McGonagall. 
H

The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split 
in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously up-
ward like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped onto the mov-
ing stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud, and they were 
moving upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished 
oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin. 
Though it was now well past midnight, there were voices coming 
from inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though 
Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people. 
Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker, 
and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them 
all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall 
led Harry and Ron inside. 
The room was in half darkness; the strange silver instruments 
standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emit-
ting puffs of smoke as they usually did. The portraits of old headmas-
ters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their 
frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red-and-gold bird the size of a 
swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing. 
“Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall . . . and . . . ah.” 
Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he 
leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers 
laid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered 
purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but 
seemed wide awake, his penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently 
upon Professor McGonagall. 
“Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare,” 
said Professor McGonagall. “He says . . .” 
“It wasn’t a nightmare,” said Harry quickly. 
Professor McGonagall looked around at Harry, frowning slightly. 
“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.” 
“I . . . well, I was asleep. . . .” said Harry and even in his terror and 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 468  
his desperation to make Dumbledore understand he felt slightly irri-
tated that the headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his 
own interlocked fingers. “But it wasn’t an ordinary dream . . . it was 
real. . . . I saw it happen. . . .” He took a deep breath, “Ron’s dad — 
Mr. Weasley — has been attacked by a giant snake.” 
The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them, 
slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumble-
dore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked 
from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked. 
“How did you see this?” Dumbledore asked quietly, still not look-
ing at Harry. 
“Well . . . I don’t know,” said Harry, rather angrily — what did it 
matter? “Inside my head, I suppose —” 
“You misunderstand me,” said Dumbledore, still in the same calm 
tone. “I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were posi-
tioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing 
beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?” 
This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; 
it was almost as though he knew . . . 
“I was the snake,” he said. “I saw it all from the snake’s point of 
view. . . .” 
Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking 
at Ron, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is 
Arthur seriously injured?” 
“Yes,” said Harry emphatically — why were they all so slow on the 
uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that 
long pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the 
courtesy of looking at him? 
But Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and ad-
dressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling. 
“Everard?” he said sharply. “And you too, Dilys!” 
A sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch

with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom 
seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes 
immediately. 
“You were listening?” said Dumbledore. 
The wizard nodded, the witch said, “Naturally.” 
“The man has red hair and glasses,” said Dumbledore. “Everard, 
you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right 
people —” 
Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead 
of emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hog-
warts), neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a 
backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair. 
Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on 
the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept 
sneaking peeks at him under their eyelids, and he suddenly under-
stood who had been talking when they had knocked. 
“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts’s most celebrated Heads,” 
Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron, and Professor 
McGonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his 
perch beside the door. “Their renown is such that both have portraits 
hanging in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to 
move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be hap-
pening elsewhere. . . .” 
“But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!” said Harry. 
“Please sit down, all three of you,” said Dumbledore, as though 
Harry had not spoken. “Everard and Dilys may not be back for several 
minutes. . . . Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra 
chairs . . .” 
Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her 
dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, 
straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz 
armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 470  
Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumble-
dore was now stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger. 
The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high 
and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes. 
“We will need,” said Dumbledore very quietly to the bird, “a 
warning.” 
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone. 
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver in-
struments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to 
his desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip 
of his wand. 
The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking 
noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule sil-
ver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow 
furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady 
stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air. . . . A serpent’s 
head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry won-
dered whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked 
eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore 
did not look up. 
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Dumbledore apparently to him-
self, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of 
surprise. “But in essence divided?” 
Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The 
smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both 
coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction 
Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: 
The clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew 
faint, became a formless haze, and vanished. 
Dumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table; 
Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him 
with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily

pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange sil-
ver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout 
from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had 
reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly. 
“Dumbledore!” 
“What news?” said Dumbledore at once. 
“I yelled until someone came running,” said the wizard, who was 
mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, “said I’d heard some-
thing moving downstairs — they weren’t sure whether to believe me 
but went down to check — you know there are no portraits down 
there to watch from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. 
He doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida 
Cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left —” 
“Good,” said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement, “I 
take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then —” 
And moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had reappeared in 
her picture too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, “Yes, 
they’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, Dumbledore. . . . They carried him 
past under my portrait. . . . He looks bad. . . .” 
“Thank you,” said Dumbledore. He looked around at Professor 
McGonagall. 
“Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.” 
“Of course. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door; Harry 
cast a sideways glance at Ron, who was now looking terrified. 
“And Dumbledore — what about Molly?” said Professor McGona-
gall, pausing at the door. 
“That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a 
lookout for anybody approaching,” said Dumbledore. “But she may 
already know . . . that excellent clock of hers . . .” 
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not 
the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 472  
family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley’s hand 
must, even now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it was very late. . . . 
Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. . . . And 
he felt cold as he remembered Mrs. Weasley’s boggart turning into 
Mr. Weasley’s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his 
face. . . . But Mr. Weasley wasn’t going to die. . . . He couldn’t. . . . 
Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and 
Ron. He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he 
placed carefully upon his desk. He raised his wand and murmured 
“Portus”; for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue 
light, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever. 
Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a 
clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted 
wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently 
sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore’s voice when he 
attempted to rouse him. 
“Phineas. Phineas.” 
And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no 
longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their 
frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the clever-
looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his 
name too. 
“Phineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!” 
He could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and 
opened his eyes wide. 
“Did someone call?” 
“I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,” said Dum-
bledore. “I’ve got another message.” 
“Visit my other portrait?” said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a 
long, fake yawn (his eyes traveling around the room and focusing 
upon Harry). “Oh no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight. . . .” 
Something about Phineas’s voice was familiar to Harry. Where had 
ST.  MUNGO’S  HOSPITAL 
FOR  MAGICAL  MALADIES 
AND  INJURIES 
 473  
he heard it before? But before he could think, the portraits on the sur-
rounding walls broke into a storm of protest. 
“Insubordination, sir!” roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, bran-
dishing his fists. “Dereliction of duty!” 
“We are honor-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of 
Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognized as 
Dumbledore’s predecessor, Armando Dippet. “Shame on you, Phineas!” 
“Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?” called a gimlet-eyed witch, 
raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod. 
“Oh, very well,” said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand 
slightly apprehensively, “though he may well have destroyed my pic-
ture by now, he’s done most of the family —” 
“Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said Dumbledore, and 
Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas’s voice before: 
issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grim-
mauld Place. “You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley 
has been gravely injured and that his wife, children, and Harry Potter 
will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?” 
“Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter 
coming to stay,” recited Phineas in a bored voice. “Yes, yes . . . very 
well. . . .” 
He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from 
view at the very moment that the study door opened again. Fred, 
George, and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all 
three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in their night 
things. 
“Harry — what’s going on?” asked Ginny, who looked frightened. 
“Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt —” 
“Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Or-
der of the Phoenix,” said Dumbledore before Harry could speak. “He 
has been taken to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and In-
juries. I am sending you back to Sirius’s house, which is much more 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 474  
convenient for the hospital than the Burrow. You will meet your 
mother there.” 
“How’re we going?” asked Fred, looking shaken. “Floo powder?” 
“No,” said Dumbledore, “Floo powder is not safe at the moment, 
the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.” He indi-
cated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. “We are just waiting 
for Phineas Nigellus to report back. . . . I wish to be sure that the coast 
is clear before sending you —” 
There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving 
behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor. 
“It is Fawkes’s warning,” said Dumbledore, catching the feather as 
it fell. “She must know you’re out of your beds. . . . Minerva, go and 
head her off — tell her any story —” 
Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan. 
“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumble-
dore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his 
Slytherin banner. “My great-great-grandson has always had odd taste 
in houseguests. . . .” 
“Come here, then,” Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. 
“And quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .” 
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore’s desk. 
“You have all used a Portkey before?” asked Dumbledore, and they 
nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle. 
“Good. On the count of three then . . . one . . . two . . .” 
It happened in a fraction of a second: In the infinitesimal pause be-
fore Dumbledore said “three,” Harry looked up at him — they were 
very close together — and Dumbledore’s clear blue gaze moved from 
the Portkey to Harry’s face. 
At once, Harry’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound 
had burst open again — and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly 
strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that

AND  INJURIES 
 475  
instant, that he would like nothing better than to strike — to bite — 
to sink his fangs into the man before him — 
“. . . three.” 
He felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from 
beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into 
the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind, 
the kettle pulling them onward and then — 
His feet hit the ground so hard that his knees buckled, the kettle 
clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, 
“Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true their father’s dying . . . ?” 
“OUT!” roared a second voice. 
Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in 
the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place. 
The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, 
which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was dis-
appearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevo-
lently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying toward them 
all, looking anxious. He was unshaven and still in his day clothes; 
there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about 
him. 
“What’s going on?” he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny 
up. “Phineas Nigellus said Arthur’s been badly injured —” 
“Ask Harry,” said Fred. 
“Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,” said George. 
The twins and Ginny were staring at him. Kreacher’s footsteps had 
stopped on the stairs outside. 
“It was —” Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGona-
gall and Dumbledore. “I had a — a kind of — vision. . . .” 
And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story 
so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the 
snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes. . . .  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 476  
Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not 
speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George, and Ginny continued 
to stare at him for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was 
imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in 
their looks. Well, if they were going to blame him for just seeing the 
attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the 
snake at the time. . . . 
“Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius. 
“She probably doesn’t even know what’s happened yet,” said Sirius. 
“The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could in-
terfere. I expect Dumbledore’s letting Molly know now.” 
“We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s,” said Ginny urgently. She looked 
around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pajamas. “Sir-
ius, can you lend us cloaks or anything — ?” 
“Hang on, you can’t go tearing off to St. Mungo’s!” said Sirius. 
“ ’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want,” said Fred, with a 
mulish expression, “he’s our dad!” 
“And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was at-
tacked before the hospital even let his wife know?” 
“What does that matter?” said George hotly. 
“It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that 
Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles 
away!” said Sirius angrily. “Have you any idea what the Ministry 
would make of that information?” 
Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the 
Ministry made of anything. Ron was still white-faced and silent. 
Ginny said, “Somebody else could have told us. . . . We could have 
heard it somewhere other than Harry. . . .” 
“Like who?” said Sirius impatiently. “Listen, your dad’s been hurt 
while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough 
without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you 
could seriously damage the Order’s —” 
ST.  MUNGO’S  HOSPITAL 
FOR  MAGICAL  MALADIES 
AND  INJURIES 
 477  
“We don’t care about the dumb Order!” shouted Fred. 
“It’s our dad dying we’re talking about!” yelled George. 
“Your father knew what he was getting into, and he won’t thank 
you for messing things up for the Order!” said Sirius angrily in his 
turn. “This is how it is — this is why you’re not in the Order — you 
don’t understand — there are things worth dying for!” 
“Easy for you to say, stuck here!” bellowed Fred. “I don’t see you 
risking your neck!” 
The little color remaining in Sirius’s face drained from it. He 
looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but 
when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. “I know it’s hard, 
but we’ve all got to act as though we don’t know anything yet. We’ve 
got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?” 
Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few 
steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron, 
who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, 
and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, 
then took seats on either side of Ginny. 
“That’s right,” said Sirius encouragingly, “come on, let’s all . . . let’s 
all have a drink while we’re waiting. Accio Butterbeer!” 
He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying 
toward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the 
debris of Sirius’s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them. 
They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crack-
ling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table. 
Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands. 
His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not 
be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And 
it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured 
that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable 
business of it being he who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first 
place. . . . 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 478  
Don’t be stupid, you haven’t got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep 
calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking. You were 
lying in bed, you weren’t attacking anyone. . . . 
But then, what just happened in Dumbledore’s office? he asked him-
self. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too. . . . 
He put the bottle down on the table a little harder than he meant 
to, so that it slopped over onto the table. No one took any notice. 
Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of 
them and as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a 
thud onto the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail 
feather. 
“Fawkes!” said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. “That’s 
not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your 
mother — here —” 
He thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and 
read aloud, “Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo’s now. Stay 
where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.” 
George looked around the table. 
“Still alive . . .” he said slowly. “But that makes it sound . . .” 
He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry too as 
though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. 
Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother’s letter as 
though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the 
parchment out of George’s hands and read it for himself, then looked 
up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again 
and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling. 
If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could 
not remember it. Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed, but 
without any real conviction, and the Weasleys’ looks of disgust were 
answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching 
the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, now and 
then raising bottles to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to 
ST.  MUNGO’S  HOSPITAL

AND  INJURIES 
 479  
wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure one another that 
if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs. 
Weasley must long since have arrived at St. Mungo’s. 
Fred fell into a doze, his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder. 
Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; 
Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his 
head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. 
And he and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon 
the family grief, waiting . . . waiting . . . 
And then, at ten past five in the morning by Ron’s watch, the 
kitchen door swung open and Mrs. Weasley entered the kitchen. She 
was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron, 
and Harry half-rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile. 
“He’s going to be all right,” she said, her voice weak with tiredness. 
“He’s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill’s sitting with him 
now, he’s going to take the morning off work.” 
Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George 
and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother, and hugged 
her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer 
in one. 
“Breakfast!” said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet. 
“Where’s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!” 
But Kreacher did not answer the summons. 
“Oh, forget it, then,” muttered Sirius, counting the people in front 
of him. “So it’s breakfast for — let’s see — seven . . . Bacon and eggs, 
I think, and some tea, and toast —” 
Harry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude 
upon the Weasleys’ happiness, and he dreaded the moment when 
Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had 
barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them 
out of his hands and pulled him into a hug. 
“I don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you, 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 480  
Harry,” she said in a muffled voice. “They might not have found 
Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to 
you he’s alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover 
story for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he 
would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis. . . .” 
Harry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon 
released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her chil-
dren through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have 
been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as 
Mr. Weasley was in hospital. 
“Oh, Sirius, I’m so grateful. . . . They think he’ll be there a little 
while and it would be wonderful to be nearer . . . Of course, that 
might mean we’re here for Christmas. . . .” 
“The more the merrier!” said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that 
Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help 
with breakfast. 
“Sirius,” Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. 
“Can I have a quick word? Er — now?” 
He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without pre-
amble Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had, 
including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had at-
tacked Mr. Weasley. 
When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell Dumbledore 
this?” 
“Yes,” said Harry impatiently, “but he didn’t tell me what it meant. 
Well, he doesn’t tell me anything anymore. . . .” 
“I’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry 
about,” said Sirius steadily. 
“But that’s not all,” said Harry in a voice only a little above a whis-
per. “Sirius, I . . . I think I’m going mad. . . . Back in Dumbledore’s 
office, just before we took the Portkey . . . for a couple of seconds  
 
ST.  MUNGO’S  HOSPITAL 
FOR  MAGICAL  MALADIES 
AND  INJURIES 
 481  
there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one — my scar really hurt 
when I was looking at Dumbledore — Sirius, I wanted to attack 
him —” 
He could only see a sliver of Sirius’s face; the rest was in darkness. 
“It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that’s all,” said Sir-
ius. “You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and —” 
“It wasn’t that,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It was like some-
thing rose up inside me, like there’s a snake inside me —” 
“You need to sleep,” said Sirius firmly. “You’re going to have break-
fast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see Arthur 
after lunch with the others. You’re in shock, Harry; you’re blaming 
yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you did wit-
ness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying. . . .” 
He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving 
Harry standing alone in the dark. 
 
Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went 
up to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer, but while 
Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully 
clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping 
himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, 
terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake 
to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house 
after one of the others. . . . 
When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing 
nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating 
lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo’s. 
Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they 
changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted 
Tonks and Mad-Eye, who had turned up to escort them across Lon-
don, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 482  
angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that 
Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far 
less attention on the underground. 
Tonks was very interested in Harry’s vision of the attack on Mr. 
Weasley, something he was not remotely interested in discussing. 
“There isn’t any Seer blood in your family, is there?” she inquired 
curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart 
of the city. 
“No,” said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling 
insulted. 
“No,” said Tonks musingly, “no, I suppose it’s not really prophecy 
you’re doing, is it? I mean, you’re not seeing the future, you’re seeing 
the present. . . . It’s odd, isn’t it? Useful, though . . .” 
Harry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a 
station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the 
train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and 
Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escala-
tor, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted 
low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, 
clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye star-
ing hard at him; trying to deflect more questions about his dream he 
asked Mad-Eye where St. Mungo’s was hidden. 
“Not far from here,” grunted Moody as they stepped out into the 
wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shop-
pers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just 
behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the 
tilted hat. “Wasn’t easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere 
in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn’t have it underground 
like the Ministry — unhealthy. In the end they managed to get hold of 
a building up here. Theory was sick wizards could come and go and 
just blend in with the crowd. . . .” 
 
ST.  MUNGO’S  HOSPITAL 
FOR  MAGICAL  MALADIES 
AND  INJURIES 
 483  
He seized Harry’s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a 
gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a 
nearby shop full of electrical gadgets. 
“Here we go,” said Moody a moment later. 
They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red brick depart-
ment store called Purge and Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, mis-
erable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies 
with their wigs askew, standing at random and modeling fashions at 
least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read 
closed for refurbishment. Harry distinctly heard a large woman 
laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, “It’s 
never open, that place. . . .” 
“Right,” said Tonks, beckoning them forward to a window display-
ing nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy whose false eye-
lashes were hanging off and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore 
dress. “Everybody ready?” 
They nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave Harry another 
shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks 
leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, 
her breath steaming up the glass, “Wotcher . . . We’re here to see 
Arthur Weasley.” 
For a split second, Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to ex-
pect the dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of 
glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the 
racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that dum-
mies could not hear anyway. Next second his mouth opened in shock 
as the dummy gave a tiny nod, beckoned its jointed finger, and Tonks 
had seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right 
through the glass and vanished. 
Fred, George, and Ron stepped after them; Harry glanced around 
at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 484  
for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of 
them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin 
air in front of them. 
“C’mon,” growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the 
back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet 
of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side. 
There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had 
stood. They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception 
area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden 
chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies 
of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as ele-
phant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was 
scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were 
making very peculiar noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the 
front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily 
Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring 
out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged 
like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated 
horribly, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady. 
Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and 
down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like 
Umbridge’s. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: 
a wand and bone, crossed. 
“Are they doctors?” he asked Ron quietly. 
“Doctors?” said Ron, looking startled. “Those Muggle nutters that 
cut people up? Nah, they’re Healers.” 
“Over here!” called Mrs. Weasley over the renewed clanging of the 
warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a 
plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked inquiries. The wall be-
hind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like a clean 
cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes 
are anti-don’ts unless approved by a qualified healer.

There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets 
that was labelled 
DILYS DERWENT

headmistress of hogwarts school of 
witchcraft and wizardry, i74i–i768 
Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party as though counting them; when 
Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her 
portrait, and vanished. 
Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was perform-
ing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to 
explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk. 
“It’s these — ouch — shoes my brother gave me — ow — they’re 
eating my — OUCH — feet — look at them, there must be some 
kind of — AARGH — jinx on them and I can’t — AAAAARGH — 
get them off —” 
He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot 
coals. 
“The shoes don’t prevent you reading, do they?” said the blonde 
witch irritably, pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. “You 
want Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just like it says on the floor guide. 
Next!” 
The wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the 
Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor 
guide:

A very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to 
the front of the queue now. 
“I’m here to see Broderick Bode!” he wheezed. 
“Ward forty-nine, but I’m afraid you’re wasting your time,” said the 
witch dismissively “He’s completely addled, you know, still thinks he’s 
a teapot. . . . Next!” 
A harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly 
by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely 
large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out the back of her 
romper suit. 
“Fourth floor,” said the witch in a bored voice, without asking, and 
the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, hold-
ing his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. “Next!” 
Mrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk. 
“Hello,” she said. “My husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to 
be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us — ?” 
“Arthur Weasley?” said the witch, running her finger down a long

list in front of her. “Yes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai 
Llewellyn ward.” 
“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Come on, you lot.” 
They followed through the double doors and along the narrow cor-
ridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers 
and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, 
looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green 
robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yel-
low gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every 
now and then they heard distant wailing. They climbed a flight of 
stairs and entered the “Creature-Induced Injuries” corridor, where the 
second door on the right bore the words “dangerous” dai llewellyn 
ward: serious bites. Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on 
which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smeth-
wyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye. 
“We’ll wait outside, Molly,” Tonks said. “Arthur won’t want too 
many visitors at once. . . . It ought to be just the family first.” 
Mad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his 
back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all direc-
tions. Harry drew back too, but Mrs. Weasley reached out a hand and 
pushed him through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly, Harry, Arthur 
wants to thank you. . . .” 
The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow 
and set high in the wall facing the door. Most of the light came from 
more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. The 
walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious-
looking wizard on the wall, captioned urquhart rackharrow, 1612–
1697, inventor of the entrail-expelling curse. 
There were only three patients. Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed 
at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window. Harry was pleased and 
relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO 
 488  
Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed. He 
looked around as they walked toward him and, seeing whom it was, 
beamed. 
“Hello!” he called, throwing the Prophet aside. “Bill just left, Molly, 
had to get back to work, but he says he’ll drop in on you later. . . .” 
“How are you, Arthur?” asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss 
his cheek and looking anxiously into his face. “You’re still looking a bit 
peaky. . . .” 
“I feel absolutely fine,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his 
good arm to give Ginny a hug. “If they could only take the bandages 
off, I’d be fit to go home.” 
“Why can’t they take them off, Dad?” asked Fred. 
“Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,” said Mr. 
Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bed-
side cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bed-
side to seat them all. “It seems there was some rather unusual kind of 
poison in that snake’s fangs that keeps wounds open. . . . They’re sure 
they’ll find an antidote, though, they say they’ve had much worse 
cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a 
Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,” he 
said, dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in 
which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. 
“Bitten by a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.” 
“A werewolf?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. “Is he 
safe in a public ward? Shouldn’t he be in a private room?” 
“It’s two weeks till full moon,” Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly. 
“They’ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know, 
trying to persuade him he’ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I 
said to him — didn’t mention names, of course — but I said I knew a 
werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite 
easy to manage. . . .” 
“What did he say?” asked George.

FOR  MAGICAL  MALADIES 
AND  INJURIES 
 489  
“Said he’d give me another bite if I didn’t shut up,” said Mr. Weasley 
sadly. “And that woman over there,” he indicated the only other occu-
pied bed, which was right beside the door, “won’t tell the Healers what 
bit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was 
handling illegally. Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg, 
very nasty smell when they take off the dressings.” 
“So, you going to tell us what happened, Dad?” asked Fred, pulling 
his chair closer to the bed. 
“Well, you already know, don’t you?” said Mr. Weasley, with a sig-
nificant smile at Harry. “It’s very simple — I’d had a very long day, 
dozed off, got sneaked up on, and bitten.” 
“Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?” asked Fred, indicating the 
newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside. 
“No, of course not,” said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile, 
“the Ministry wouldn’t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent 
got —” 
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley warningly. 
“— got — er — me,” Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was 
quite sure that was not what he had meant to say. 
“So where were you when it happened, Dad?” asked George. 
“That’s my business,” said Mr. Weasley, though with a small smile. 
He snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook it open again and said, “I 
was just reading about Willy Widdershins’s arrest when you arrived. 
You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets 
last summer? One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded, and they 
found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to 
foot in —” 
“When you say you were ‘on duty,’ ” Fred interrupted in a low 
voice, “what were you doing?” 
“You heard your father,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, “we are not dis-
cussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur —” 
“Well, don’t ask me how, but he actually got off on the toilet 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO

charge,” said Mr. Weasley grimly. “I can only suppose gold changed 
hands —” 
“You were guarding it, weren’t you?” said George quietly. “The 
weapon? The thing You-Know-Who’s after?” 
“George, be quiet!” snapped Mrs. Weasley. 
“Anyway,” said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, “this time Willy’s 
been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don’t think 
he’ll be able to worm his way out of it because according to this arti-
cle, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo’s for 
emergency bone regrowth and memory modification. Just think of it, 
Muggles in St. Mungo’s! I wonder which ward they’re in?” 
And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost. 
“Didn’t you say You-Know-Who’s got a snake, Harry?” asked Fred, 
looking at his father for a reaction. “A massive one? You saw it the 
night he returned, didn’t you?” 
“That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “Mad-Eye and Tonks 
are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can 
wait outside,” she added to her children and Harry. “You can come 
and say good-bye afterward. Go on. . . .” 
They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in 
and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows. 
“Fine,” he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, “be like that. 
Don’t tell us anything.” 
“Looking for these?” said George, holding out what looked like a 
tangle of flesh-colored string. 
“You read my mind,” said Fred, grinning. “Let’s see if St. Mungo’s 
puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?” 
He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extend-
able Ears from each other. Fred and George handed them around. 
Harry hesitated to take one. 
“Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad’s life, if anyone’s got the right 
to eavesdrop on him it’s you. . . .”

AND  INJURIES 
 491  
Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and 
inserted it into his ear as the twins had done. 
“Okay, go!” Fred whispered. 
The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then 
snaked under the door. For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing, 
then he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were stand-
ing right beside him. 
“. . . they searched the whole area but they couldn’t find the snake 
anywhere, it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur. 
. . . But You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can 
he?” 
“I reckon he sent it as a lookout,” growled Moody, “ ’cause he’s not 
had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he’s trying to get a clearer pic-
ture of what he’s facing and if Arthur hadn’t been there the beast 
would’ve had much more time to look around. So Potter says he saw 
it all happen?” 
“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. “You know, 
Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see 
something like this. . . .” 
“Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the 
Potter kid, we all know that.” 
“Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him 
this morning,” whispered Mrs. Weasley. 
“ ’Course he’s worried,” growled Moody. “The boy’s seeing things 
from inside You-Know-Who’s snake. . . . Obviously, Potter doesn’t re-
alize what that means, but if You-Know-Who’s possessing him —” 
Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart ham-
mering very fast and heat rushing up his face. He looked around at the 
others. They were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their 
ears, looking suddenly fearful.

as this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry’s 
eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, 
afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, 
with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face 
of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quir-
rell’s head, and he ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering 
what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. . . . 
He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some 
deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the 
hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were 
free of the taint of Voldemort. . . . He had not merely seen the snake, 
he had been the snake, he knew it now. . . . 
And then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bob-
bing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and 
squirm like serpents. . . . 
“What’s he after apart from followers?” 
“Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn’t 
have last time.” 
W 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 493  
I’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were 
pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat 
as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I’m the one Volde-
mort’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I  
go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working, 
they can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts. . . . I did attack  
Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, Voldemort made me do it and he could 
be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now. . . . 
“Are you all right, Harry, dear?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, leaning 
across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its 
dark tunnel. “You don’t look very well. Are you feeling sick?” 
They were all watching him. He shook his head violently and 
stared up at an advertisement for home insurance. 
“Harry, dear, are you sure you’re all right?” said Mrs. Weasley in a 
worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in 
the middle of Grimmauld Place. “You look ever so pale. . . . Are you 
sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now, and 
you can have a couple of hours’ sleep before dinner, all right?” 
He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the 
others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the 
front door he proceeded straight past the troll’s leg umbrella stand and 
up the stairs and hurried into his and Ron’s bedroom. 
Here he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas 
Nigellus’s empty portrait, his brain teeming and seething with ques-
tions and ever more dreadful ideas. . . . 
How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus. . . . 
No, he couldn’t be, he would know. . . . perhaps Voldemort was an 
Animagus. . . . Yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into 
a snake of course . . . and when he’s possessing me, then we both trans-
form. . . . That still doesn’t explain how come I got to London and back 
to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though. . . . But then 
Voldemort’s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 494  
Dumbledore, it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport people 
like that. . . . 
And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is in-
sane — if Voldemort’s possessing me, I’m giving him a clear view into the  
headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He’ll know who’s in 
the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I’ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn’t  
have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here. . . . 
There was only one thing for it: He would have to leave Grim-
mauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts 
without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at 
least. . . . But no, that wouldn’t do, there were still plenty of people at 
Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville 
next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigel-
lus’s empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his 
stomach. He had no alternative: He was going to have to return to 
Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely. . . . 
Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging 
around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were 
going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months ear-
lier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the 
lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig 
before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts — well, her cage 
would be one less thing to carry — he seized one end of his trunk and 
had dragged it halfway toward the door when a sneaky voice said, 
“Running away, are we?” 
He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas 
of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with 
an amused expression on his face. 
“Not running away, no,” said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a 
few more feet across the room. 
“I thought,” said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, 
“that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave? 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 495  
It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own 
house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, 
given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.” 
“It’s not my own neck I’m saving,” said Harry tersely, tugging the 
trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in 
front of the door. 
“Oh I see,” said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard. “This is 
no cowardly flight — you are being noble.” 
Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas 
Nigellus said lazily, “I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.” 
Harry spun around. 
“What is it?” 
“Stay where you are.” 
“I haven’t moved!” said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. 
“So what’s the message?” 
“I have just given it to you, dolt,” said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. 
“Dumbledore says, ‘Stay where you are.’” 
“Why?” said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. “Why 
does he want me to stay? What else did he say?” 
“Nothing whatsoever,” said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black 
eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent. 
Harry’s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long 
grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had ex-
perienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours, 
and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him! 
“So that’s it, is it?” he said loudly. “Stay there? That’s all anyone 
could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too! Just stay put 
while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won’t bother telling you 
anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to 
cope with it!” 
“You know,” said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, 
“this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 496  
infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. 
Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there 
might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not 
confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, 
while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore’s or-
ders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, 
you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize 
danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the 
Dark Lord may be planning. . . .” 
“He is planning something to do with me, then?” said Harry 
swiftly. 
“Did I say that?” said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk 
gloves. “Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than to 
listen to adolescent agonizing. . . . Good day to you. . . .” 
And he strolled into his frame and out of sight. 
“Fine, go then!” Harry bellowed at the empty frame. “And tell 
Dumbledore thanks for nothing!” 
The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his 
trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself facedown upon 
the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching. . . . 
He felt he had journeyed miles and miles. . . . It seemed impossible 
that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approach-
ing him under the mistletoe. . . . He was so tired. . . . He was scared to 
sleep . . . yet he did not know how long he could fight it. . . . Dum-
bledore had told him to stay. . . . That must mean he was allowed to 
sleep. . . . But he was scared. . . . What if it happened again . . . ? 
He was sinking into shadows. . . . 
It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He 
was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door, past 
rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway onto a flight of stone 
steps leading downstairs on the left. . . . 
He reached the black door but could not open it. . . . He stood gaz-
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 497  
ing at it, desperate for entry. . . . Something he wanted with all his heart 
lay beyond. . . . A prize beyond his dreams. . . . If only his scar would 
stop prickling . . . then he would be able to think more clearly. . . . 
“Harry,” said Ron’s voice, from far, far away, “Mum says dinner’s 
ready, but she’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed. . . .” 
Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room. 
He doesn’t want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after 
what he heard Moody say . . . 
He supposed none of them would want him there anymore now 
that they knew what was inside him. . . . 
He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company 
upon them. He turned over onto his other side and after a while 
dropped back off to sleep, waking much later in the early hours of the 
morning, with his insides aching with hunger, and Ron snoring in the 
next bed. Squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of 
Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to 
Harry that Dumbledore had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch 
over him, in case he attacked somebody else. 
The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half wished he had not 
obeyed Dumbledore and stayed. . . . If this was how life was going to 
be in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in 
Privet Drive after all. 
 
Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas 
decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a 
good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that 
he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice 
echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room 
where he was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows 
growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage plea-
sure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking 
about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 498  
Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he re-
treated farther upstairs and ignored her. 
It was around six o’clock in the evening that the doorbell rang and 
Mrs. Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or 
some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled 
himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hip-
pogriff’s room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he 
felt as he fed Buckbeak dead rats. It came as a slight shock when some-
body hammered hard on the door a few minutes later. 
“I know you’re in there,” said Hermione’s voice. “Will you please 
come out? I want to talk to you.” 
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked her, pulling open the door, 
as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any 
fragments of rat he might have dropped. “I thought you were skiing 
with your mum and dad.” 
“Well, to tell the truth, skiing’s not really my thing,” said Hermi-
one. “So I’ve come for Christmas.” There was snow in her hair and her 
face was pink with cold. “But don’t tell Ron that, I told him it’s really 
good because he kept laughing so much. Anyway, Mum and Dad are 
a bit disappointed, but I’ve told them that everyone who’s serious 
about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do 
well, they’ll understand. Anyway,” she said briskly, “let’s go to your 
bedroom, Ron’s mum’s lit a fire in there and she’s sent up sandwiches.” 
Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the 
bedroom he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting 
for them, sitting on Ron’s bed. 
“I came on the Knight Bus,” said Hermione airily, pulling off her 
jacket before Harry had time to speak. “Dumbledore told me what 
had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to 
end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot 
disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her

Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo’s, and he’d given you all permission to 
visit. So . . .” 
She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron looked up 
at Harry. 
“How’re you feeling?” asked Hermione. 
“Fine,” said Harry stiffly. 
“Oh, don’t lie, Harry,” she said impatiently. “Ron and Ginny say 
you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. 
Mungo’s.” 
“They do, do they?” said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron 
looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed. 
“Well, you have!” she said. “And you won’t look at any of us!” 
“It’s you lot who won’t look at me!” said Harry angrily. 
“Maybe you’re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each 
other,” suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching. 
“Very funny,” snapped Harry, turning away. 
“Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,” said Hermione sharply. 
“Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the 
Extendable Ears —” 
“Yeah?” growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched 
the snow now falling thickly outside. “All been talking about me, have 
you? Well, I’m getting used to it. . . .” 
“We wanted to talk to you, Harry,” said Ginny, “but as you’ve been 
hiding ever since we got back —” 
“I didn’t want anyone to talk to me,” said Harry, who was feeling 
more and more nettled. 
“Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as 
you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by You-Know-
Who, and I can tell you how it feels.” 
Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. 
Then he turned on the spot to face her. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 500  
“I forgot,” he said. 
“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly. 
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and he meant it. “So . . . so do you think 
I’m being possessed, then?” 
“Well, can you remember everything you’ve been doing?” Ginny 
asked. “Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve 
been up to?” 
Harry racked his brains. 
“No,” he said. 
“Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you,” said Ginny sim-
ply. “When he did it to me, I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing 
for hours at a time. I’d find myself somewhere and not know how I 
got there.” 
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost 
in spite of himself. 
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —” 
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had 
flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.” 
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside 
that snake. It was like I was the snake. . . . What if Voldemort some-
how transported me to London — ?” 
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 
“you’ll read Hogwarts, A History, and perhaps that will remind you 
that you can’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even Volde-
mort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.” 
“You didn’t leave your bed, mate,” said Ron. “I saw you thrashing 
around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up. . . .” 
Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What 
they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense. . . . 
Without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed 
and crammed it hungrily into his mouth. . . . 
I’m not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 501  
happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius 
tramping past their door toward Buckbeak’s room, singing “God Rest 
Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice. 
 
How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christ-
mas? Sirius’s delight at having the house full again, and especially at 
having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host 
of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should en-
joy themselves as much, if not more, than they would have done at 
Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, 
cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all 
went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable. The 
tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with 
garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered 
in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained 
by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius’s family 
tree from view; and even the stuffed elf heads on the hall wall wore Fa-
ther Christmas hats and beards. 
Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at 
the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, 
rather larger, pile. 
“Good haul this year,” he informed Harry through a cloud of pa-
per. “Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats Hermi-
one’s — she’s got me a homework planner —” 
Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione’s 
handwriting on it. She had given him too a book that resembled a di-
ary, except that it said things like “Do it today or later you’ll pay!” every 
time he opened a page. 
Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled 
Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had 
superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it 
described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 502  
it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A. Hagrid had 
sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably sup-
posed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry 
putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks’s 
present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry 
watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; 
Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and 
Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; 
and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been 
done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside down to see 
whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and 
George Apparated at the foot of his bed. 
“Merry Christmas,” said George. “Don’t go downstairs for a bit.” 
“Why not?” said Ron. 
“Mum’s crying again,” said Fred heavily. “Percy sent back his 
Christmas jumper.” 
“Without a note,” added George. “Hasn’t asked how Dad is or vis-
ited him or anything. . . .” 
“We tried to comfort her,” said Fred, moving around the bed to 
look at Harry’s portrait. “Told her Percy’s nothing more than a hu-
mongous pile of rat droppings —” 
“— didn’t work,” said George, helping himself to a Chocolate 
Frog. “So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go 
down for breakfast, I reckon.” 
“What’s that supposed to be anyway?” asked Fred, squinting at 
Dobby’s painting. “Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.” 
“It’s Harry!” said George, pointing at the back of the picture. “Says 
so on the back!” 
“Good likeness,” said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new home-
work diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it 
said happily, “If you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s then you may do 
whatever you please!” 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 503  
They got up and dressed; they could hear various inhabitants of the 
house calling “Merry Christmas” to each other. On their way down-
stairs they met Hermione. “Thanks for the book, Harry!” she said 
happily. “I’ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! 
And that perfume is really unusual, Ron.” 
“No problem,” said Ron. “Who’s that for anyway?” he added, nod-
ding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying. 
“Kreacher,” said Hermione brightly. 
“It had better not be clothes!” said Ron warningly. “You know what 
Sirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free!” 
“It isn’t clothes,” said Hermione, “although if I had my way I’d cer-
tainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, 
it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.” 
“What bedroom?” said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as 
they were passing the portrait of Sirius’s mother. 
“Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of — 
den,” said Hermione. “Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that 
cupboard off the kitchen.” 
Mrs. Weasley was the only person in the basement when they ar-
rived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she 
had a bad head cold when she wished them Merry Christmas, and 
they all averted their eyes. 
“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said Ron, strolling over to a dingy 
door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen 
open. 
“Yes,” said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. “Er . . . I 
think we’d better knock . . .” 
Ron rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply. 
“He must be sneaking around upstairs,” he said, and without fur-
ther ado pulled open the door. “Urgh.” 
Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a 
very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot’s space underneath 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 504  
the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a 
nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on 
the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where 
Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the 
material were stale bread crusts and moldy old bits of cheese. In a far 
corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher 
had saved, magpielike, from Sirius’s purge of the house, and he had 
also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that 
Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shat-
tered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered 
haughtily up at him, including — he felt a little jolt in his stomach — 
the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dum-
bledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was 
Kreacher’s favorite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the 
others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape. 
“I think I’ll just leave his present here,” said Hermione, laying the 
package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets 
and closing the door quietly. “He’ll find it later, that’ll be fine. . . .” 
“Come to think of it,” said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carry-
ing a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, “has anyone 
actually seen Kreacher lately?” 
“I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here,” said Harry. 
“You were ordering him out of the kitchen.” 
“Yeah . . .” said Sirius, frowning. “You know, I think that’s the last 
time I saw him, too. . . . He must be hiding upstairs somewhere. . . .” 
“He couldn’t have left, could he?” said Harry. “I mean, when you 
said ‘out,’ maybe he thought you meant, get out of the house?” 
“No, no, house-elves can’t leave unless they’re given clothes, they’re 
tied to their family’s house,” said Sirius. 
“They can leave the house if they really want to,” Harry contra-
dicted him. “Dobby did, he left the Malfoys’ to give me warnings two 
years ago. He had to punish himself afterward, but he still managed it.” 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 505  
Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, “I’ll 
look for him later, I expect I’ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out 
over my mother’s old bloomers or something. . . . Of course, he might 
have crawled into the airing cupboard and died. . . . But I mustn’t get 
my hopes up. . . .” 
Fred, George, and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked 
reproachful. 
Once they had had their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and Harry 
and Hermione were planning to pay Mr. Weasley another visit, es-
corted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for 
Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to “borrow” a car for 
the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The 
car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowl-
edge or consent of its owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put 
upon it as the Weasleys’ old Ford Anglia; although normally propor-
tioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit 
into it quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated at the point of get-
ting inside; Harry knew that her disapproval of Mundungus was bat-
tling with her dislike of traveling without magic; finally the cold 
outside and her children’s pleading triumphed, and she settled herself 
into the backseat between Fred and Bill with good grace. 
The journey to St. Mungo’s was quite quick, as there was very little 
traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards were creep-
ing furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. 
Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off 
around the corner to wait for them; they strolled casually toward the 
window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, 
stepped through the glass. 
The reception area looked pleasantly festive: The crystal orbs that 
illuminated St. Mungo’s had been turned to red and gold so that they 
became gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every 
doorway, and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 506  
and icicles glittered in every corner, each topped with a gleaming gold 
star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, al-
though halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside 
by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril. 
“Family argument, eh?” smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. 
“You’re the third I’ve seen today . . . Spell Damage, fourth floor . . .” 
They found Mr. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his 
turkey dinner on a tray in his lap and a rather sheepish expression on 
his face. 
“Everything all right, Arthur?” asked Mrs. Weasley, after they had 
all greeted Mr. Weasley and handed over their presents. 
“Fine, fine,” said Mr. Weasley, a little too heartily. “You — er — 
haven’t seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?” 
“No,” said Mrs. Weasley suspiciously, “why?” 
“Nothing, nothing,” said Mr. Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his 
pile of gifts. “Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for 
Christmas? Oh, Harry — this is absolutely wonderful —” 
For he had just opened Harry’s gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers. 
Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley’s an-
swer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry’s hand, she peered at 
the bandaging under his nightshirt. 
“Arthur,” she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, 
“you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your ban-
dages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn’t need 
doing until tomorrow.” 
“What?” said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the 
bed covers higher up his chest. “No, no — it’s nothing — it’s — I —” 
He seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasley’s piercing gaze. 
“Well — now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an 
idea. . . . He’s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and 
very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine. . . . I mean,  
 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 507  
some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they’re called stitches, 
Molly, and they work very well on — on Muggle wounds —” 
Mrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a 
shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the 
werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the 
crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting 
himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, 
grinning. 
“Do you mean to tell me,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing 
louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visi-
tors were scurrying for cover, “that you have been messing about with 
Muggle remedies?” 
“Not messing about, Molly, dear,” said Mr. Weasley imploringly. 
“It was just — just something Pye and I thought we’d try — only, 
most unfortunately — well, with these particular kinds of wounds — 
it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped —” 
“Meaning?” 
“Well . . . well, I don’t know whether you know what — what 
stitches are?” 
“It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back to-
gether,” said Mrs. Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, “but 
even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid —” 
“I fancy a cup of tea too,” said Harry, jumping to his feet. 
Hermione, Ron, and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. 
As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek, 
“WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT’S THE GENERAL IDEA?” 
“Typical Dad,” said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the 
corridor. “Stitches . . . I ask you . . .” 
“Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,” said 
Hermione fairly. “I suppose something in that snake’s venom dissolves 
them or something. . . . I wonder where the tearoom is?” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 508  
“Fifth floor,” said Harry, remembering the sign over the Welcome 
Witch’s desk. 
They walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and 
found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking 
Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, di-
agnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was 
seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly 
had a bad case of spattergroit. 
“And what’s that supposed to be?” he asked angrily, as the Healer 
pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of 
the way. 
“ ’Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will 
leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now —” 
“Watch who you’re calling gruesome!” said Ron, his ears turning red. 
“The only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about 
your throat, stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels’ eyes —” 
“I have not got spattergroit!” 
“But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master —” 
“They’re freckles!” said Ron furiously. “Now get back in your own 
picture and leave me alone!” 
He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly 
straight faces. 
“What floor’s this?” 
“I think it’s the fifth,” said Hermione. 
“Nah, it’s the fourth,” said Harry, “one more —” 
But as he stepped onto the landing he came to an abrupt halt, star-
ing at the small window set into the double doors that marked the 
start of a corridor signposted spell damage. A man was peering out 
at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond 
hair, bright blue eyes, and a broad vacant smile that revealed daz-
zlingly white teeth. 
 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 509  
“Blimey!” said Ron, also staring at the man. 
“Oh my goodness,” said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. 
“Professor Lockhart!” 
Their ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the 
doors and moved toward them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown. 
“Well, hello there!” he said. “I expect you’d like my autograph, 
would you?” 
“Hasn’t changed much, has he?” Harry muttered to Ginny, who 
grinned. 
“Er — how are you, Professor?” said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. 
It had been Ron’s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor 
Lockhart’s memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place, 
though, as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry 
and Ron’s memories at the time, Harry’s sympathy was limited. 
“I’m very well indeed, thank you!” said Lockhart exuberantly, 
pulling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. “Now, 
how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing 
now, you know!” 
“Er — we don’t want any at the moment, thanks,” said Ron, rais-
ing his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, “Professor, should you be wan-
dering around the corridors? Shouldn’t you be in a ward?” 
The smile faded slowly from Lockhart’s face. For a few moments he 
gazed intently at Harry, then he said, “Haven’t we met?” 
“Er . . . yeah, we have,” said Harry. “You used to teach us at Hog-
warts, remember?” 
“Teach?” repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. “Me? Did I?” 
And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was 
rather alarming. “Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? 
Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, 
you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left 
out!” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 510  
But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the cor-
ridor and a voice said, “Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you 
wandered off to?” 
A motherly looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came 
bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others. 
“Oh Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas 
Day too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can’t 
think why, he’s such a sweetie, aren’t you?” 
“We’re doing autographs!” Gilderoy told the Healer with another 
glittering smile. “They want loads of them, won’t take no for an an-
swer! I just hope we’ve got enough photographs!” 
“Listen to him,” said the Healer, taking Lockhart’s arm and beam-
ing fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. “He 
was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this 
liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be com-
ing back a little bit. Will you step this way? He’s in a closed ward, you 
know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas 
presents, the door’s usually kept locked . . . not that he’s dangerous! 
But,” she lowered her voice to a whisper, “bit of a danger to himself, 
bless him. . . . Doesn’t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can’t 
remember how to get back. . . . It is nice of you to have come to see 
him —” 
“Er,” said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, “actually, 
we were just — er —” 
But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron’s feeble 
mutter of “going to have a cup of tea” trailed away into nothingness. 
They looked at one another rather hopelessly and then followed Lock-
hart and his Healer along the corridor. 
“Let’s not stay long,” Ron said quietly. 
The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey 
ward and muttered “Alohomora.” The door swung open and she led  
 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 511  
the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy’s arm until she had 
settled him into an armchair beside his bed. 
“This is our long-term resident ward,” she informed Harry, Ron, 
Hermione, and Ginny in a low voice. “For permanent spell damage, 
you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and 
a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. . . . Gilderoy does 
seem to be getting back some sense of himself, and we’ve seen a real 
improvement in Mr. Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of 
speech very well, though he isn’t speaking any language we recognize 
yet. . . . Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I’ll 
leave you all to chat. . . .” 
Harry looked around; this ward bore unmistakable signs of being a 
permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal ef-
fects around their beds than in Mr. Weasley’s ward; the wall around 
Gilderoy’s headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of him-
self, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had au-
tographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. 
The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer, 
Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs toward him, seized a 
quill, and started signing them all feverishly. 
“You can put them in envelopes,” he said to Ginny, throwing the 
signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. “I am not 
forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail. 
. . . Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly. . . . I just wish I knew why. . . .” 
He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned 
to his signing with renewed vigor. “I suspect it is simply my good 
looks. . . .” 
A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed oppo-
site, staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed 
quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman 
whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 512  
similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although 
fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the 
far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds 
to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy. 
“Here you are, Agnes,” said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced 
woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. “See, not for-
gotten, are you? And your son’s sent an owl to say he’s visiting tonight, 
so that’s nice, isn’t it?” 
Agnes gave several loud barks. 
“And look, Broderick, you’ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely 
calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month, they’ll 
brighten things up, won’t they?” said the Healer, bustling along to the 
mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tenta-
cles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her 
wand. “And — oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?” 
Harry’s head spun round. The curtains had been drawn back from 
the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking 
back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch 
wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur, and a pointed hat 
decorated with what was unmistakably a stuffed vulture and, trailing 
behind her looking thoroughly depressed — Neville. 
With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the 
people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some 
means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward 
unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had looked up at the sound of 
the name “Longbottom” too, and before Harry could stop him had 
called, “Neville!” 
Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly 
missed him. 
“It’s us, Neville!” said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. “Have you 
seen? Lockhart’s here! Who’ve you been visiting?” 
 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD 
 513  
“Friends of yours, Neville, dear?” said Neville’s grandmother gra-
ciously, bearing down upon them all. 
Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world 
but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he 
was not making eye contact with any of them. 
“Ah, yes,” said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and stick-
ing out a shriveled, clawlike hand for him to shake. “Yes, yes, I know 
who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.” 
“Er — thanks,” said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at 
him, but stared at his own feet, the color deepening in his face all the 
while. 
“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mrs. Longbottom continued, 
proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. “Yes, I know 
your parents — not well, of course — but fine people, fine people . . . 
and you must be Hermione Granger?” 
Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs. Longbottom knew her 
name, but shook hands all the same. 
“Yes, Neville’s told me all about you. Helped him out of a few 
sticky spots, haven’t you? He’s a good boy,” she said, casting a sternly 
appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, “but he hasn’t 
got his father’s talent, I’m afraid to say. . . .” And she jerked her head 
in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the 
stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly. 
“What?” said Ron, looking amazed (Harry wanted to stamp on 
Ron’s foot, but that sort of thing was much harder to bring off unno-
ticed when you were wearing jeans rather than robes). “Is that your 
dad down the end, Neville?” 
“What’s this?” said Mrs. Longbottom sharply. “Haven’t you told 
your friends about your parents, Neville?” 
Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook 
his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone,  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE 
 514  
but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the 
situation. 
“Well, it’s nothing to be ashamed of!” said Mrs. Longbottom an-
grily. “You should be proud, Neville, proud! They didn’t give their 
health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, 
you know!” 
“I’m not ashamed,” said Neville very faintly, still looking anywhere 
but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look 
over at the inhabitants of the two beds. 
“Well, you’ve got a funny way of showing it!” said Mrs. Longbot-
tom. “My son and his wife,” she said, turning haughtily to Harry, 
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, “were tortured into insanity by You-
Know-Who’s followers.” 
Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. 
Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville’s parents 
and looked mortified. 
“They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the 
Wizarding community,” Mrs. Longbottom went on. “Highly gifted, 
the pair of them. I — yes, Alice dear, what is it?” 
Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. 
She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in 
Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her 
face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, 
which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not 
seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made 
timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched 
hand. 
“Again?” said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. “Very 
well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is. . . .” 
But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his 
mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper. 
“Very nice, dear,” said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery 
CHRISTMAS  ON  THE 
CLOSED  WARD

voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, 
“Thanks Mum.” 
His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. 
Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though 
daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found any-
thing less funny in his life. 
“Well, we’d better get back,” sighed Mrs. Longbottom, drawing on 
long green gloves. “Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that 
wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper 
your bedroom by now. . . .” 
But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into 
his pocket. 
The door closed behind them. 
“I never knew,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. 
“Nor did I,” said Ron rather hoarsely. 
“Nor me,” whispered Ginny. 
They all looked at Harry. 
“I did,” he said glumly. “Dumbledore told me but I promised I 
wouldn’t mention it . . . that’s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to 
Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville’s parents until they 
lost their minds.” 
“Bellatrix Lestrange did that?” whispered Hermione, horrified. 
“That woman Kreacher’s got a photo of in his den?” 
There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart’s angry voice. “Look, 
I didn’t learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!”

reacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic. Sirius said 
he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking 
for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard. Though 
Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher 
seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance, his bitter mutter-
ing had subsided somewhat, and he submitted to orders more docilely 
than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring 
avidly at him, always looking quickly away when he saw that Harry 
had noticed. 
Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheer-
fulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over. As the date 
of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and 
more prone to what Mrs. Weasley called “fits of the sullens,” in which 
he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buck-
beak’s room for hours at a time. His gloom seeped through the house, 
oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them be-
came infected by it. 
Harry did not want to leave Sirius all alone again with only Kreacher 
K 
OCCLUMENCY 
 517  
for company. In fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking 
forward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean 
placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, 
who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in 
their absence. Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now 
that he had been banned; there was every likelihood that their burden 
of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; Dumble-
dore remained as remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A., 
Harry felt he might have gone to Sirius and begged him to let him leave 
Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place. 
Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened 
that made Harry positively dread his return to school. 
“Harry dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, poking her head into his and 
Ron’s bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess 
watched by Hermione, Ginny, and Crookshanks, “could you come 
down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.” 
Harry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his 
castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron’s, and he 
was egging it on enthusiastically. 
“Squash him — squash him, he’s only a pawn, you idiot — sorry, 
Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?” 
“Professor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. He’d like a word.” 
Harry’s mouth fell open in horror. He looked around at Ron, 
Hermione, and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at him. Crook-
shanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the 
past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully upon the board and set the 
pieces running for cover, squealing at the top of their voices. 
“Snape?” said Harry blankly. 
“Professor Snape, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley reprovingly. “Now come 
on, quickly, he says he can’t stay long.” 
“What’s he want with you?” said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs. 
Weasley withdrew from the room. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 518  
“You haven’t done anything, have you?” 
“No!” said Harry indignantly, racking his brains to think what he 
could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld 
Place. Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T? 
He pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sir-
ius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in oppo-
site directions. The silence between them was heavy with mutual 
dislike. A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius. 
“Er,” said Harry to announce his presence. 
Snape looked around at him, his face framed between curtains of 
greasy black hair. 
“Sit down, Potter.” 
“You know,” said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs 
and speaking to the ceiling, “I think I’d prefer it if you didn’t give or-
ders here, Snape. It’s my house, you see.” 
An ugly flush suffused Snape’s pallid face. Harry sat down in a chair 
beside Sirius, facing Snape across the table. 
“I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,” said Snape, the familiar 
sneer curling his mouth, “but Black —” 
“I’m his godfather,” said Sirius, louder than ever. 
“I am here on Dumbledore’s orders,” said Snape, whose voice, by 
contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, “but by all 
means stay, Black, I know you like to feel . . . involved.” 
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Sirius, letting his chair fall 
back onto all four legs with a loud bang. 
“Merely that I am sure you must feel — ah — frustrated by the fact 
that you can do nothing useful,” Snape laid a delicate stress on the 
word, “for the Order.” 
It was Sirius’s turn to flush. Snape’s lip curled in triumph as he 
turned to Harry. 
“The headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish 
for you to study Occlumency this term.” 
OCCLUMENCY 
 519  
“Study what?” said Harry blankly. 
Snape’s sneer became more pronounced. 
“Occlumency, Potter. The magical defense of the mind against ex-
ternal penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful 
one. 
Harry’s heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defense against ex-
ternal penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all 
agreed on that. . . . 
“Why do I have to study Occlu — thing?” he blurted out. 
“Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea,” said Snape 
smoothly. “You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will 
not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. 
You understand?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. “Who’s going to be teaching me?” 
Snape raised an eyebrow. 
“I am,” he said. 
Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting. Ex-
tra lessons with Snape — what on earth had he done to deserve this? 
He looked quickly around at Sirius for support. 
“Why can’t Dumbledore teach Harry?” asked Sirius aggressively. 
“Why you?” 
“I suppose because it is a headmaster’s privilege to delegate less en-
joyable tasks,” said Snape silkily. “I assure you I did not beg for the 
job.” He got to his feet. “I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday 
evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial 
Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need 
them.” 
He turned to leave, his black traveling cloak billowing behind him. 
“Wait a moment,” said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair. 
Snape turned back to face them, sneering. 
“I am in rather a hurry, Black . . . unlike you, I do not have unlim-
ited leisure time. . . .” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 520  
“I’ll get to the point, then,” said Sirius, standing up. He was rather 
taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, had balled his fist in the pocket 
of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. “If 
I hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard 
time, you’ll have me to answer to.” 
“How touching,” Snape sneered. “But surely you have noticed that 
Potter is very like his father?” 
“Yes, I have,” said Sirius proudly. 
“Well then, you’ll know he’s so arrogant that criticism simply 
bounces off him,” Snape said sleekly. 
Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table 
toward Snape, pulling out his wand as he went; Snape whipped out 
his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, 
Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius’s wand tip to his face. 
“Sirius!” said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him. 
“I’ve warned you, Snivellus,” said Sirius, his face barely a foot from 
Snape’s, “I don’t care if Dumbledore thinks you’ve reformed, I know 
better —” 
“Oh, but why don’t you tell him so?” whispered Snape. “Or are you 
afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding in-
side his mother’s house for six months very seriously?” 
“Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he’s delighted 
his lapdog’s working at Hogwarts, isn’t he?” 
“Speaking of dogs,” said Snape softly, “did you know that Lucius 
Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? 
Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . . 
gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, 
didn’t it?” 
Sirius raised his wand. 
“NO!” Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in be-
tween them, “Sirius, don’t —” 
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 521  
“Are you calling me a coward?” roared Sirius, trying to push Harry 
out of the way, but Harry would not budge. 
“Why, yes, I suppose I am,” said Snape. 
“Harry — get — out — of — it!” snarled Sirius, pushing him out 
of the way with his free hand. 
The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus 
Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr. Weasley 
walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas 
covered by a mackintosh. 
“Cured!” he announced brightly to the kitchen at large. “Com-
pletely cured!” 
He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the 
scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both 
Sirius and Snape looking toward the door with their wands pointing 
into each other’s faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand 
stretched out to each of them, trying to force them apart. 
“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley, the smile sliding off his face, 
“what’s going on here?” 
Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands. Harry looked from one 
to the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the 
unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought 
them to their senses. Snape pocketed his wand and swept back across 
the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he 
looked back. 
“Six o’clock Monday evening, Potter.” 
He was gone. Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side. 
“But what’s been going on?” asked Mr. Weasley again. 
“Nothing, Arthur,” said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though 
he had just run a long distance. “Just a friendly little chat between two 
old school friends. . . .” With what looked like an enormous effort, he 
smiled. “So . . . you’re cured? That’s great news, really great. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 522  
“Yes, isn’t it?” said Mrs. Weasley, leading her husband forward into 
a chair. “Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an 
antidote to whatever that snake’s got in its fangs, and Arthur’s learned 
his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven’t you, dear?” she 
added, rather menacingly. 
“Yes, Molly dear,” said Mr. Weasley meekly. 
That night’s meal should have been a cheerful one with Mr. 
Weasley back amongst them; Harry could tell Sirius was trying to 
make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh 
loudly at Fred and George’s jokes or offering everyone more food, his 
face fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated 
from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer 
Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell 
him that he should not listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was 
goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sir-
ius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in 
Grimmauld Place, but he had no opportunity to do so, and wondered 
occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether he would 
have dared to even if he had the chance. Instead he told Ron and 
Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons 
with Snape. 
“Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Volde-
mort,” said Hermione at once. “Well, you won’t be sorry not to have 
them anymore, will you?” 
“Extra lessons with Snape?” said Ron, sounding aghast. “I’d rather 
have the nightmares!” 
They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following 
day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eat-
ing breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived 
there next morning. The adults seemed to have been midway through 
a whispered conversation when the door opened; all of them looked 
around hastily and fell silent. 
OCCLUMENCY 
 523  
After a hurried breakfast they pulled on jackets and scarves against 
the chilly gray January morning. Harry had an unpleasant constricted 
sensation in his chest; he did not want to say good-bye to Sirius. He 
had a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know when they 
would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon him to 
say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid — Harry 
was worried that Snape’s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so 
badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond 
Grimmauld Place. Before he could think of what to say, however, Sir-
ius had beckoned him to his side. 
“I want you to take this,” he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped 
package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands. 
“What is it?” Harry asked. 
“A way of letting me know if Snape’s giving you a hard time. No, 
don’t open it in here!” said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley, 
who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. “I 
doubt Molly would approve — but I want you to use it if you need 
me, all right?” 
“Okay,” said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket 
of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was. It 
would not be he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no 
matter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlu-
mency classes. 
“Let’s go, then,” said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and 
smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were 
heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front 
door, surrounded by Weasleys. 
“Good-bye, Harry, take care,” said Mrs. Weasley, hugging him. 
“See you Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me!” said Mr. 
Weasley genially, shaking his hand. 
“Right — yeah,” said Harry distractedly. It was his last chance to 
tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfather’s face and 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 524  
opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giv-
ing him a brief, one-armed hug. He said gruffly, “Look after yourself, 
Harry,” and next moment Harry found himself being shunted out 
into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, 
tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying him down the steps. 
The door of number twelve slammed shut behind them. They fol-
lowed Lupin down the front steps. As he reached the pavement, Harry 
looked around. Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on ei-
ther side of it stretched sideways, squeezing it out of sight; one blink 
later, it had gone. 
“Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,” said Tonks, 
and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw 
around the square. Lupin flung out his right arm. 
BANG. 
A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in 
front of them, narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped 
backward out of its way. 
A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down 
onto the pavement and said, “Welcome to the —” 
“Yes, yes, we know, thank you,” said Tonks swiftly. “On, on, get 
on — 
And she shoved Harry forward toward the steps, past the conduc-
tor, who goggled at Harry as he passed. 
“ ’Ere — it’s ’Arry — !” 
“If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,” muttered 
Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forward. 
“I’ve always wanted to go on this thing,” said Ron happily, joining 
Harry on board and looking around. 
It had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by Knight Bus 
and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads. Now, in the early 
morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs  
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 525  
grouped haphazardly around windows. Some of these appeared to 
have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place; 
a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet, grumbling, 
and somebody’s shopping bag had slid the length of the bus; an un-
pleasant mixture of frog spawn, cockroaches, and custard creams was 
scattered all over the floor. 
“Looks like we’ll have to split up,” said Tonics briskly, looking 
around for empty chairs. “Fred, George, and Ginny, if you just take 
those seats at the back . . . Remus can stay with you. . . .” 
She, Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck, 
where there were two chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the 
back. Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed Harry and Ron eagerly 
to the back. Heads turned as Harry passed and when he sat down, he 
saw all the faces flick back to the front again. 
As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off 
again, swaying ominously. It rumbled around Grimmauld Square, 
weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous 
BANG, they were all flung backward; Ron’s chair toppled right over 
and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, burst out of his cage and 
flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered 
down upon Hermione’s shoulder instead. Harry, who had narrowly 
avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: 
they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway. 
“Just outside Birmingham,” said Stan happily, answering Harry’s 
unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor. “You keepin’ 
well, then, ’Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer, 
but it weren’t never nuffink very nice. . . . I said to Ern, I said, ‘ ’e didn’t 
seem like a nutter when we met ’im, just goes to show, dunnit?’ ” 
He handed over their tickets and continued to gaze, enthralled, at 
Harry; apparently Stan did not care how nutty somebody was if they 
were famous enough to be in the paper. The Knight Bus swayed  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 526  
alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars on the inside. Looking toward the 
front of the bus Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands, 
Pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder. 
BANG. 
Chairs slid backward again as the Knight Bus jumped from the 
Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends. 
Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as 
they mounted the verges. From here they moved to a main street in 
the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, 
then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a 
loud BANG. 
“I’ve changed my mind,” muttered Ron, picking himself up from 
the floor for the sixth time, “I never want to ride on here again.” 
“Listen, it’s ’Ogwarts stop after this,” said Stan brightly, swaying to-
ward them. “That bossy woman up front ’oo got on with you, she’s 
given us a little tip to move you up the queue. We’re just gonna let 
Madam Marsh off first, though —” There was more retching from 
downstairs, followed by a horrible spattering sound. “She’s not feeling 
’er best. 
A few minutes later the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a 
small pub, which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision. 
They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of 
the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the 
second deck. The bus moved on again, gathering speed, until — 
BANG. 
They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a 
glimpse of the Hog’s Head down its side street, the severed boar’s head 
sign creaking in the wintry wind. Flecks of snow hit the large window 
at the front of the bus. At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to 
Hogwarts. 
Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage and 
then got off to say good-bye. Harry glanced up at the three decks of 
OCCLUMENCY 
 527  
the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses 
flat against the windows. 
“You’ll be safe once you’re in the grounds,” said Tonks, casting a 
careful eye around at the deserted road. “Have a good term, okay?” 
“Look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round and 
reaching Harry last. “And listen . . .” He lowered his voice while the 
rest of them exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “Harry, I 
know you don’t like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we 
all — Sirius included — want you to learn to protect yourself, so 
work hard, all right?” 
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin’s pre-
maturely lined face. “See you, then . . .” 
The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle 
dragging their trunks. Hermione was already talking about knitting a 
few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back when they reached 
the oak front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone, and he half-
wished, given what was coming the following day, that he was still on 
board. 
 
Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. His morning 
Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation, as Snape was as 
unpleasant as ever, and Harry’s mood was further lowered by the fact 
that members of the D.A. were continually approaching him in the 
corridors between classes, asking hopefully whether there would be a 
meeting that night. 
“I’ll let you know when the next one is,” Harry said over and over 
again, “but I can’t do it tonight, I’ve got to go to — er — Remedial 
Potions. . . .” 
“You take Remedial Potions?” asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, 
having cornered Harry in the entrance hall after lunch. “Good Lord, 
you must be terrible, Snape doesn’t usually give extra lessons, does 
he?” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 528  
As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron 
glared after him. 
“Shall I jinx him? I can still get him from here,” he said, raising his 
wand and taking aim between Smith’s shoulder blades. 
“Forget it,” said Harry dismally. “It’s what everyone’s going to 
think, isn’t it? That I’m really stup —” 
“Hi, Harry,” said a voice behind him. He turned around and found 
Cho standing there. 
“Oh,” said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably. “Hi.” 
“We’ll be in the library, Harry,” said Hermione firmly, and she 
seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble 
staircase. 
“Had a good Christmas?” asked Cho. 
“Yeah, not bad,” said Harry. 
“Mine was pretty quiet,” said Cho. For some reason, she was look-
ing rather embarrassed. “Erm . . . there’s another Hogsmeade trip 
next month, did you see the notice?” 
“What? Oh no, I haven’t checked the notice board since I got 
back. . . .” 
“Yes, it’s on Valentine’s Day. . . .” 
“Right,” said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this. 
“Well, I suppose you want to — ?” 
“Only if you do,” she said eagerly. 
Harry stared. He had been about to say “I suppose you want to 
know when the next D.A. meeting is?” but her response did not seem 
to fit. 
“I — er —” he said. 
“Oh, it’s okay if you don’t,” she said, looking mortified. “Don’t 
worry. I-I’ll see you around.” 
She walked away. Harry stood staring after her, his brain working 
frantically. Then something clunked into place. 
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 529  
“Cho! Hey — CHO!” 
He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase. 
“Er — d’you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valen-
tine’s Day?” 
“Oooh, yes!” she said, blushing crimson and beaming at him. 
“Right . . . well . . . that’s settled then,” said Harry, and feeling that 
the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he headed off to 
the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon 
lessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself. 
By six o’clock that evening, however, even the glow of having suc-
cessfully asked out Cho Chang was insufficient to lighten the omi-
nous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward 
Snape’s office. 
He paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were al-
most anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and entered. 
It was a shadowy room lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass 
jars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants, suspended in 
variously colored potions. In a corner stood the cupboard full of in-
gredients that Snape had once accused Harry — not without 
reason — of robbing. Harry’s attention was drawn toward the desk, 
however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and sym-
bols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognized it at once — Dum-
bledore’s Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing here, he 
jumped when Snape’s cold voice came out of the corner. 
“Shut the door behind you, Potter.” 
Harry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was im-
prisoning himself as he did so. When he turned back to face the room 
Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair 
opposite his desk. Harry sat down and so did Snape, his cold black 
eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of his 
face. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 530  
“Well, Potter, you know why you are here,” he said. “The head-
master has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that 
you prove more adept at it than Potions.” 
“Right,” said Harry tersely. 
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said Snape, his eyes 
narrowed malevolently, “but I am still your teacher and you will there-
fore call me ‘sir’ or ‘Professor’ at all times.” 
“Yes . . . sir,” said Harry. 
“Now, Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather’s 
kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion 
and influence.” 
“And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?” said 
Harry, looking directly into Snape’s dark, cold eyes and wondering 
whether he would answer. 
Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptu-
ously, “Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter? 
The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency —” 
“What’s that? Sir?” 
“It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another per-
son’s mind —” 
“He can read minds?” said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed. 
“You have no subtlety, Potter,” said Snape, his dark eyes glittering. 
“You do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcom-
ings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker.” 
Snape paused for a moment, apparently to savor the pleasure of 
insulting Harry, before continuing, “Only Muggles talk of ‘mind 
reading.’ The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined 
at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be 
perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered 
thing, Potter . . . or at least, most minds are. . . .” He smirked. “It is 
true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, un- 
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 531  
der certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to 
interpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost 
always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at 
Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that 
contradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in his presence without 
detection.” 
Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind reading to 
Harry and he did not like the sound of it at all. 
“So he could know what we’re thinking right now? Sir?” 
“The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and 
grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms 
to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within 
them,” said Snape. “Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye con-
tact is often essential to Legilimency.” 
“Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?” 
Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as 
he did so. 
“The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse 
that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection 
between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times, 
when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable — when you are 
asleep, for instance — you are sharing the Dark Lord’s thoughts and 
emotions. The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue. 
He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark 
Lord.” 
Harry’s heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up. 
“But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?” he asked 
abruptly. “I don’t like it much, but it’s been useful, hasn’t it? I mean 
. . . I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadn’t, Professor 
Dumbledore wouldn’t have been able to save him, would he? Sir?” 
Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 532  
with his finger. When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as 
though he weighed every word. 
“It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection 
between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that 
you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts 
without his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly 
before Christmas —” 
“The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?” 
“Do not interrupt me, Potter,” said Snape in a dangerous voice. “As 
I was saying . . . the vision you had shortly before Christmas repre-
sented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord’s thoughts —” 
“I saw inside the snake’s head, not his!” 
“I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?” 
But Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he seemed to be 
getting to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his 
chair so that, without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, 
tense as though poised for flight. 
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s 
thoughts I’m sharing?” 
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” spat Snape. 
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the 
Pensieve. 
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly. 
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. 
“While he may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of 
us . . .” He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the 
spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin. 
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back 
to politeness, “why —” 
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where 
the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He  
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 533  
was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were in-
side it too. . . .” 
“And Vol — he — realized I was there?” 
“It seems so,” said Snape coolly. 
“How do you know?” said Harry urgently. “Is this just Professor 
Dumbledore guessing, or — ?” 
“I told you,” said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, “to call me 
‘sir.’” 
“Yes, sir,” said Harry impatiently, “but how do you know — ?” 
“It is enough that we know,” said Snape repressively. “The impor-
tant point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining 
access to his thoughts and feelings. He has also deduced that the 
process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realized that 
he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return —” 
“And he might try and make me do things?” asked Harry. “Sir?” he 
added hurriedly. 
“He might,” said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned. “Which 
brings us back to Occlumency.” 
Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and 
Harry tensed in his chair, but Snape merely raised the wand to his 
temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair. When he 
withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from tem-
ple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as he pulled the 
wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it 
swirled silvery white, neither gas nor liquid. Twice more Snape 
raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance 
into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his 
behavior, he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a shelf 
out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at 
the ready. 
“Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 534  
Harry got to his feet feeling nervous. They faced each other with 
the desk between them. 
“You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend your-
self in any other way you can think of,” said Snape. 
“And what are you going to do?” Harry asked, eyeing Snape’s wand 
apprehensively. 
“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly. 
“We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you 
have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. . . . You 
will find that similar powers are needed for this. . . . Brace yourself, 
now. . . . Legilimens!” 
Snape had struck before Harry was ready, before Harry had even 
begun to summon any force of resistance: the office swam in front of 
his eyes and vanished, image after image was racing through his mind 
like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings. . . . 
He was five, watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle, and his 
heart was bursting with jealousy. . . . He was nine, and Ripper the 
bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the Dursleys were laughing be-
low on the lawn. . . . He was sitting under the Sorting Hat, and it was 
telling him he would do well in Slytherin. . . . Hermione was lying in 
the hospital wing, her face covered with thick black hair. . . . A hun-
dred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake. . . . Cho 
Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe. . . . 
No, said a voice in Harry’s head, as the memory of Cho drew nearer, 
you’re not watching that, you’re not watching it, it’s private — 
He felt a sharp pain in his knee. Snape’s office had come back into 
view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees 
had collided painfully with the leg of Snape’s desk. He looked up at 
Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There 
was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark. 
“Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?” asked Snape coolly. 
“No,” said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor. 
OCCLUMENCY 
 535  
“I thought not,” said Snape contemptuously. “You let me get in too 
far. You lost control.” 
“Did you see everything I saw?” Harry asked, unsure whether he 
wanted to hear the answer. 
“Flashes of it,” said Snape, his lip curling. “To whom did the dog 
belong?” 
“My Aunt Marge,” Harry muttered, hating Snape. 
“Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have 
been,” said Snape, raising his wand once more. “You managed to stop 
me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. You 
must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need 
to resort to your wand.” 
“I’m trying,” said Harry angrily, “but you’re not telling me how!” 
“Manners, Potter,” said Snape dangerously. “Now, I want you to 
close your eyes.” 
Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told. He did 
not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced 
him, carrying a wand. 
“Clear your mind, Potter,” said Snape’s cold voice. “Let go of all 
emotion. . . .” 
But Harry’s anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins 
like venom. Let go of his anger? He could as easily detach his legs. . . . 
“You’re not doing it, Potter. . . . You will need more discipline than 
this. . . . Focus, now. . . .” 
Harry tried to empty his mind, tried not to think, or remember, or 
feel. . . . 
“Let’s go again . . . on the count of three . . . one — two — 
three — Legilimens!” 
A great black dragon was rearing in front of him. . . . His father 
and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror. . . . 
Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at 
him. . . . 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 536  
“NOOOOOOO!” 
He was on his knees again, his face buried in his hands, his brain 
aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull. 
“Get up!” said Snape sharply. “Get up! You are not trying, you are 
making no effort, you are allowing me access to memories you fear, 
handing me weapons!” 
Harry stood up again, his heart thumping wildly as though he had 
really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard. Snape looked paler than 
usual, and angrier, though not nearly as angry as Harry was. 
“I — am — making — an — effort,” he said through clenched 
teeth. 
“I told you to empty yourself of emotion!” 
“Yeah? Well, I’m finding that hard at the moment,” Harry snarled. 
“Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!” said 
Snape savagely. “Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, 
who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and 
allow themselves to be provoked this easily — weak people, in other 
words — they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate 
your mind with absurd ease, Potter!” 
“I am not weak,” said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping 
through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment. 
“Then prove it! Master yourself!” spat Snape. “Control your anger, 
discipline your mind! We shall try again! Get ready, now! Legilimens!” 
He was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letter box shut. . . . 
A hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds to-
ward him. . . . He was running along a windowless passage with Mr. 
Weasley. . . . They were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the 
end of the corridor. . . . Harry expected to go through it . . . but Mr. 
Weasley led him off to the left, down a flight of stone steps. . . . 
“I KNOW! I KNOW!” 
He was on all fours again on Snape’s office floor, his scar was prick- 
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 537  
ling unpleasantly, but the voice that had just issued from his mouth 
was triumphant. He pushed himself up again to find Snape staring at 
him, his wand raised. It looked as though, this time, Snape had lifted 
the spell before Harry had even tried to fight back. 
“What happened then, Potter?” he asked, eyeing Harry intently. 
“I saw — I remembered,” Harry panted. “I’ve just realized . . .” 
“Realized what?” asked Snape sharply. 
Harry did not answer at once; he was still savoring the moment of 
blinding realization as he rubbed his forehead. . . . 
He had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a 
locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place. 
Now, seeing the memory again, he knew that all along he had been 
dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr. 
Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in 
the Ministry. It was the corridor leading to the Department of Mys-
teries, and Mr. Weasley had been there the night that he had been at-
tacked by Voldemort’s snake. . . . 
He looked up at Snape. 
“What’s in the Department of Mysteries?” 
“What did you say?” Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep 
satisfaction, that Snape was unnerved. 
“I said, what’s in the Department of Mysteries, sir?” Harry said. 
“And why,” said Snape slowly, “would you ask such a thing?” 
“Because,” said Harry, watching Snape closely for a reaction, “that 
corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been dreaming about it for months — 
I’ve just recognized it — it leads to the Department of Mysteries . . . 
and I think Voldemort wants something from —” 
“I have told you not to say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
They glared at each other. Harry’s scar seared again, but he did not 
care. Snape looked agitated. When he spoke again he sounded as 
though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 538  
“There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, 
few of which you would understand and none of which concern you, 
do I make myself plain?” 
“Yes,” Harry said, still rubbing his prickling scar, which was be-
coming more painful. 
“I want you back here same time on Wednesday, and we will con-
tinue work then.” 
“Fine,” said Harry. He was desperate to get out of Snape’s office 
and find Ron and Hermione. 
“You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before 
sleep — empty it, make it blank and calm, you understand?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, who was barely listening. 
“And be warned, Potter . . . I shall know if you have not prac-
ticed . . .” 
“Right,” Harry mumbled. He picked up his schoolbag, swung it 
over his shoulder, and hurried toward the office door. As he opened it 
he glanced back at Snape, who had his back to Harry and was scoop-
ing his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and 
replacing them carefully inside his own head. Harry left without an-
other word, closing the door carefully behind him, his scar still throb-
bing painfully. 
Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library, where they were 
working on Umbridge’s most recent ream of homework. Other stu-
dents, nearly all of them fifth years, sat at lamp-lit tables nearby, noses 
close to books, quills scratching feverishly, while the sky outside the 
mullioned windows grew steadily blacker. The only other sound was 
the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pince’s shoes as the librarian 
prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down the necks of those 
touching her precious books. 
Harry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, he felt almost feverish. 
When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione he caught sight of  
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 539  
himself in the window opposite. He was very white, and his scar 
seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual. 
“How did it go?” Hermione whispered, and then, looking con-
cerned, “Are you all right, Harry?” 
“Yeah . . . fine . . . I dunno,” said Harry impatiently, wincing as 
pain shot through his scar again. “Listen . . . I’ve just realized some-
thing. . . .” 
And he told them what he had just seen and deduced. 
“So . . . so, are you saying . . .” whispered Ron, as Madam Pince 
swept past, squeaking slightly, “that the weapon — the thing You-
Know-Who’s after — is in the Ministry of Magic?” 
“In the Department of Mysteries, it’s got to be,” Harry whispered. 
“I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for 
my hearing and it’s definitely the same one he was guarding when the 
snake bit him.” 
Hermione let out a long, slow sigh. “Of course,” she breathed. 
“Of course what?” said Ron rather impatiently. 
“Ron, think about it. . . . Sturgis Podmore was trying to get 
through a door at the Ministry of Magic. . . . It must have been that 
one, it’s too much of a coincidence!” 
“How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he’s on our side?” 
said Ron. 
“Well, I don’t know,” Hermione admitted. “That is a bit odd. . . .” 
“So what’s in the Department of Mysteries?” Harry asked Ron. 
“Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?” 
“I know they call the people who work in there ‘Unspeakables,’” 
said Ron, frowning. “Because no one really seems to know what they 
do in there. . . . Weird place to have a weapon . . .” 
“It’s not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,” said Hermione. “It will 
be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I ex-
pect. . . . Harry, are you sure you’re all right?” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 540  
For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as 
though trying to iron it. 
“Yeah . . . fine . . .” he said, lowering his hands, which were trem-
bling. “I just feel a bit . . . I don’t like Occlumency much. . . .” 
“I expect anyone would feel shaky if they’d had their mind attacked 
over and over again,” said Hermione sympathetically. “Look, let’s get 
back to the common room, we’ll be a bit more comfortable there. . . .” 
But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter 
and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit 
of joke shop merchandise. 
“Headless Hats!” shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat dec-
orated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. “Two 
Galleons each — watch Fred, now!” 
Fred swept the hat onto his head, beaming. For a second he merely 
looked rather stupid, then both hat and head vanished. 
Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter. 
“And off again!” shouted George, and Fred’s hand groped for a mo-
ment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head 
reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it again. 
“How do those hats work, then?” said Hermione, distracted from 
her homework and watching Fred and George. “I mean, obviously it’s 
some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it’s rather clever to have extended 
the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object. 
. . . I’d imagine the charm wouldn’t have a very long life though. . . .” 
Harry did not answer; he was still feeling ill. 
“I’m going to have to do this tomorrow,” he muttered, pushing the 
books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it. 
“Well, write it in your homework planner then!” said Hermione 
encouragingly. “So you don’t forget!” 
Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag, with-
drew the planner and opened it tentatively. 
 
OCCLUMENCY 
 541  
“Don’t leave it till later, you big second-rater!” chided the book as 
Harry scribbled down Umbridge’s homework. Hermione beamed at it. 
“I think I’ll go to bed,” said Harry, stuffing the homework planner 
back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the 
first opportunity he got. 
He walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried 
to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the 
stone staircase to the boys’ dormitories. He was feeling sick again, just 
as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought 
that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right. 
He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it 
when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must 
have sliced into the top of his head. He did not know where he was, 
whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own 
name. . . . 
Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears. . . . He was happier than 
he had been in a very long time. . . . Jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant . . . 
A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened. . . . 
“Harry? HARRY!” 
Someone had hit him around the face. The insane laughter was 
punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of 
him, but the laughter continued. . . . 
He opened his eyes and as he did so, he became aware that the wild 
laughter was coming out of his own mouth. The moment he realized 
this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the 
ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending 
over him, looking very worried. 
“What happened?” he said. 
“I . . . dunno . . .” Harry gasped, sitting up again. “He’s really 
happy . . . really happy . . .” 
“You-Know-Who is?” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR 
 542  
“Something good’s happened,” mumbled Harry. He was shaking as 
badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt 
very sick. “Something he’s been hoping for.” 
The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing 
room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry’s 
mouth, yet he knew they were true. He took deep breaths, willing 
himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and 
Seamus were not here to watch this time. 
“Hermione told me to come and check on you,” said Ron in a low 
voice, helping Harry to his feet. “She says your defenses will be low at 
the moment, after Snape’s been fiddling around with your mind. . . . 
Still, I suppose it’ll help in the long run, won’t it?” 
He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him toward bed. Harry 
nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows, 
aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, 
his scar still prickling painfully. He could not help feeling that his first 
foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind’s resistance rather 
than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepi-
dation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he 
had been in fourteen years.

arry’s question was answered the very next morning. When 
Hermione’s Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed 
for a moment at the front page, and then gave a yelp that caused every-
one in the vicinity to stare at her. 
“What?” said Harry and Ron together. 
For an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of 
them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the 
whole of the front page, nine showing wizards’ faces and the tenth, a 
witch’s. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; 
others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, look-
ing insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime 
for which the person had been sent to Azkaban. 
Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, 
pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry, convicted of the bru-
tal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. 
Augustus Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man 
with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture,  
 
H 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 544  
looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 
But Harry’s eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face 
had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, 
dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he 
had seen it sleek, thick, and shining. She glared up at him through 
heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her 
thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but 
something — perhaps Azkaban — had taken most of her beauty. 
Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapaci-
tation of Frank and Alice Longbottom. 
Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pic-
tures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read. 
MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN 
MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS “RALLYING POINT” 
FOR OLD DEATH EATERS 
 
“Black?” said Harry loudly. “Not — ?” 
“Shhh!” whispered Hermione desperately. “Not so loud — just 
read it!” 
 
The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that 
there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban. 
Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cor-
nelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, confirmed that ten 
high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of 
yesterday evening, and that he has already informed 
the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature 
of these individuals. 
“We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the 
same position we were two and a half years ago when 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 545  
the murderer Sirius Black escaped,” said Fudge last 
night. “Nor do we think the two breakouts are unre-
lated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside 
help, and we must remember that Black, as the first 
person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally 
placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think 
it likely that these individuals, who include Black’s 
cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black 
as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to 
round up the criminals and beg the magical commu-
nity to remain alert and cautious. On no account 
should any of these individuals be approached.” 
“There you are, Harry,” said Ron, looking awestruck. “That’s why 
he was happy last night. . . .” 
“I don’t believe this,” snarled Harry, “Fudge is blaming the break-
out on Sirius?” 
“What other options does he have?” said Hermione bitterly. “He 
can hardly say, ‘Sorry everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might 
happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort’ — stop 
whimpering, Ron — ‘and now Voldemort’s worst supporters have bro-
ken out too.’ I mean, he’s spent a good six months telling everyone 
you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn’t he?” 
Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report 
inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall. He could not un-
derstand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least 
discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of 
them took the newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all 
were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what 
other rubbish, and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had 
swollen Voldemort’s ranks. . . . 
He glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story here: 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 546  
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, 
both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had the Prophet 
propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page 
with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of 
egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at 
the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl 
of porridge. For once her pouchy toad’s eyes were not sweeping the 
Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she 
gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent 
glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talk-
ing so intently. 
“Oh my —” said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the 
newspaper. 
“What now?” said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy. 
“It’s . . . horrible,” said Hermione, looking shaken. She folded back 
page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to Harry and Ron. 
TRAGIC DEMISE OF 
MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER 
St. Mungo’s Hospital promised a full inquiry last 
night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick 
Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by 
a potted-plant. Healers called to the scene were unable 
to revive Mr. Bode, who had been injured in a 
workplace accident some weeks prior to his death. 
Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. 
Bode’s ward at the time of the incident, has been sus-
pended on full pay and was unavailable for comment 
yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in 
a statement, “St. Mungo’s deeply regrets the death of 
Mr. Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior 
to this tragic accident. 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 547  
“We have strict guidelines on the decorations per-
mitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout, 
busy over the Christmas period, overlooked the 
dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode’s bedside table. As 
his speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout en-
couraged Mr. Bode to look after the plant himself, 
unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom, but 
a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by 
the convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly. 
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the 
presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch 
or wizard with information to come forward.” 
“Bode . . .” said Ron. “Bode. It rings a bell. . . .” 
“We saw him,” Hermione whispered. “In St. Mungo’s, remember? 
He was in the bed opposite Lockhart’s, just lying there, staring at the 
ceiling. And we saw the Devil’s Snare arrive. She — the Healer — 
said it was a Christmas present. . . .” 
Harry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like 
bile in his throat. 
“How come we didn’t recognize Devil’s Snare . . . ? We’ve seen it 
before . . . we could’ve stopped this from happening . . .” 
“Who expects Devil’s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a 
potted plant?” said Ron sharply. “It’s not our fault, whoever sent it to 
the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didn’t they check 
what they were buying?” 
“Oh come on, Ron!” said Hermione shakily, “I don’t think anyone 
could put Devil’s Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever 
touches it? This — this was murder. . . . A clever murder, as well. . . . 
If the plant was sent anonymously, how’s anyone ever going to find 
out who did it?” 
Harry was not thinking about Devil’s Snare. He was remembering 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 548  
taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of 
his hearing, and the sallow-faced man who had got in on the Atrium 
level. 
“I met Bode,” he said slowly. “I saw him at the Ministry with your 
dad . . .” 
Ron’s mouth fell open. 
“I’ve heard Dad talk about him at home! He was an Unspeak-
able — he worked in the Department of Mysteries!” 
They looked at one another for a moment, then Hermione pulled 
the newspaper back toward her, closed it, glared for a moment at the 
pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her 
feet. 
“Where are you going?” said Ron, startled. 
“To send a letter,” said Hermione, swinging her bag onto her 
shoulder. “It . . . well, I don’t know whether . . . but it’s worth trying 
. . . and I’m the only one who can . . .” 
“I hate it when she does that,” grumbled Ron as he and Harry got 
up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great 
Hall. “Would it kill her to tell us what she’s up to for once? It’d take 
her about ten more seconds — hey, Hagrid!” 
Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall, wait-
ing for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass. He was still as heavily bruised 
as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the 
giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose. 
“All righ’, you two?” he said, trying to muster a smile but managing 
only a kind of pained grimace. 
“Are you okay, Hagrid?” asked Harry, following him as he lum-
bered after the Ravenclaws. 
“Fine, fine,” said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he 
waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking 
Professor Vector, who was passing. “Jus’ busy, yeh know, usual stuff —  
 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 549  
lessons ter prepare — couple o’ salamanders got scale rot — an’ I’m 
on probation,” he mumbled. 
“You’re on probation?” said Ron very loudly, so that many students 
passing looked around curiously. “Sorry — I mean — you’re on pro-
bation?” he whispered. 
“Yeah,” said Hagrid. “ ’S’no more’n I expected, ter tell yeh the 
truth. Yeh migh’ not’ve picked up on it, bu’ that inspection didn’ go 
too well, yeh know . . . anyway,” he sighed deeply. “Bes’ go an rub a 
bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tails’ll be hangin’ 
off ’em next. See yeh, Harry . . . Ron . . .” 
He trudged away, out the front doors and down the stone steps into 
the damp grounds. Harry watched him go, wondering how much 
more bad news he could stand. 
 
The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowl-
edge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry’s indigna-
tion, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some 
people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively 
gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mys-
teries employee in St. Mungo’s, Harry, Ron, and Hermione seemed to 
be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of 
conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, 
whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few 
people who read the newspapers. Rumors were flying that some of the 
convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to 
be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to 
break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done. 
Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing 
the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear 
as Voldemort’s; the crimes they had committed during the days 
of Voldemort’s reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 550  
their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found them-
selves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as 
they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and 
cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably 
during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be 
Harry. 
“And I don’t know how you stand it, it’s horrible,” she said bluntly, 
dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap 
seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort. 
It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering 
and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a 
slight difference in the tone of the whisperers’ voices. They sounded 
curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he over-
heard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were 
not satisfied with the Prophet’s version of how and why ten Death 
Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress. In their confu-
sion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only 
other explanation available to them, the one that Harry and Dumble-
dore had been expounding since the previous year. 
It was not only the students’ mood that had changed. It was now 
quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, 
urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the 
moment they saw students approaching. 
“They obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore,” said 
Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry, and Ron passed Professors 
McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the 
Charms classroom one day. “Not with Umbridge there.” 
“Reckon they know anything new?” said Ron, gazing back over his 
shoulder at the three teachers. 
“If they do, we’re not going to hear about it, are we?” said Harry an-
grily. “Not after Decree . . . What number are we on now?” 
 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 551  
For new signs had appeared on the house notice boards the morn-
ing after news of the Azkaban breakout: 
—  by order of  — 
The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts 
Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any infor-
mation that is not strictly related to the subjects they are 
paid to teach. 
The above is in accordance with 
Educational Decree Number Twenty-six. 
Signed: 
 
 
high inquisitor 
 
 
This latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes 
among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by 
the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George 
off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class. 
“Exploding Snap’s got nothing to do with Defense Against the 
Dark Arts, Professor! That’s not information relating to your subject!” 
When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather 
badly. Harry recommended essence of murtlap. 
Harry had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have 
humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the 
catastrophe that had occurred right under her beloved Fudge’s nose. It 
seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring 
every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control. She  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 552  
seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, 
and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or 
Hagrid who went first. 
Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was 
now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard. She 
lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting 
Professor Trelawney’s increasingly hysterical talks with difficult ques-
tions about Ornithomancy and Heptomology, insisting that she pre-
dict students’ answers before they gave them and demanding that she 
demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves, and the rune 
stones in turn. Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon 
crack under the strain; several times he passed her in the corridors (in 
itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower 
room), muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands, and shooting 
terrified glances over her shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful 
smell of cooking sherry. If he had not been so worried about Hagrid, 
he would have felt sorry for her — but if one of them was to be ousted 
out of a job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who 
should remain. 
Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a 
better show than Trelawney. Though he seemed to be following Her-
mione’s advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than 
a crup, a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except 
for its forked tail, since before Christmas, he also seemed to have lost 
his nerve. He was oddly distracted and jumpy in lessons, losing the 
thread of what he was saying while talking to the class, answering 
questions wrongly and glancing anxiously at Umbridge all the time. 
He was also more distant with Harry, Ron, and Hermione than he had 
ever been before, expressly forbidding them to visit him after dark. 
“If she catches yeh, it’ll be all of our necks on the line,” he told 
them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job 
further, they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings. 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 553  
It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of 
everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to Ha-
grid’s house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt, and Quidditch. He took 
his revenge the only way he had: redoubling his efforts for the D.A. 
Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, 
had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more 
Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improve-
ment more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his parents’ at-
tacker’s escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming 
change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo’s, and taking 
their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said 
anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers’ escape; in 
fact, he barely spoke during D.A. meetings anymore, but worked re-
lentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse Harry taught them, his 
plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to in-
juries or accidents, working harder than anyone else in the room. He 
was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught 
them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that 
they rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the 
charm faster than Neville. 
In fact Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much 
progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D.A. meetings. 
Harry’s sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were 
not improving; on the contrary, Harry felt he was getting worse with 
every lesson. 
Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled 
occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those 
strange flashes of Voldemort’s thoughts or moods that he experienced 
every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped 
prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that 
were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 554  
always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He 
had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of 
aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort’s mood, and 
he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first 
Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dream-
ing about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the 
Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams that always cul-
minated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door. 
“Maybe it’s a bit like an illness,” said Hermione, looking concerned 
when Harry confided in her and Ron. “A fever or something. It has to 
get worse before it gets better.” 
“It’s lessons with Snape that are making it worse,” said Harry flatly. 
“I’m getting sick of my scar hurting, and I’m getting bored walking 
down that corridor every night.” He rubbed his forehead angrily. “I 
just wish the door would open, I’m sick of standing staring at it —” 
“That’s not funny,” said Hermione sharply. “Dumbledore doesn’t 
want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn’t 
have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You’re just going to have 
to work a bit harder in your lessons.” 
“I am working!” said Harry, nettled. “You try it sometime, Snape 
trying to get inside your head, it’s not a bundle of laughs, you know!” 
“Maybe . . .” said Ron slowly. 
“Maybe what?” said Hermione rather snappishly. 
“Maybe it’s not Harry’s fault he can’t close his mind,” said Ron darkly. 
“What do you mean?” said Hermione. 
“Well, maybe Snape isn’t really trying to help Harry. . . .” 
Harry and Hermione stared at him. Ron looked darkly and mean-
ingfully from one to the other. 
“Maybe,” he said again in a lower voice, “he’s actually trying to 
open Harry’s mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know —” 
“Shut up, Ron,” said Hermione angrily. “How many times have  
 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 555  
you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumble-
dore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.” 
“He used to be a Death Eater,” said Ron stubbornly. “And we’ve 
never seen proof that he really swapped sides. . . .” 
“Dumbledore trusts him,” Hermione repeated. “And if we can’t 
trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone.” 
 
With so much to worry about and so much to do — startling 
amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working 
until past midnight, secret D.A. meetings, and regular classes with 
Snape — January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry 
knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer 
weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year. 
Harry had had very little time to spare on conversations with Cho 
since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found 
himself facing a Valentine’s Day spent entirely in her company. 
On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully. 
He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post 
owls. Hedwig was not there — not that he had expected her — but 
Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown 
owl as they sat down. 
“And about time! If it hadn’t come today . . .” she said eagerly, tear-
ing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment. 
Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a 
grimly pleased expression spread across her face. 
“Listen, Harry,” she said, looking up at him. “This is really impor-
tant. . . . Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks 
around midday?” 
“Well . . . I dunno,” said Harry dubiously. “Cho might be expect-
ing me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were 
going to do.” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 556  
“Well, bring her along if you must,” said Hermione urgently. “But 
will you come?” 
“Well . . . all right, but why?” 
“I haven’t got time to tell you now, I’ve got to answer this 
quickly —” 
And she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one 
hand and a piece of uneaten toast in the other. 
“Are you coming?” Harry asked Ron, but he shook his head, look-
ing glum. 
“I can’t come into Hogsmeade at all, Angelina wants a full day’s 
training. Like it’s going to help — we’re the worst team I’ve ever seen. 
You should see Sloper and Kirke, they’re pathetic, even worse than I 
am.” He heaved a great sigh. “I dunno why Angelina won’t just let me 
resign. . . .” 
“It’s because you’re good when you’re on form, that’s why,” said 
Harry irritably. 
He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron’s plight when he 
himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forth-
coming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to notice Harry’s tone, 
because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and 
there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each 
other shortly afterward. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and 
Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection 
in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the entrance hall to 
meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth 
they were going to talk about. 
She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors, 
looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long ponytail. Harry’s 
feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked toward her, and he 
was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they looked 
swinging at his sides. 
 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 557  
“Hi,” said Cho slightly breathlessly. 
“Hi,” said Harry. 
They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, “Well — 
er — shall we go, then?” 
“Oh — yes . . .” 
They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occa-
sionally catching each other’s eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking 
to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, find-
ing it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awk-
ward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch 
stadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands 
and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them. . . . 
“You really miss it, don’t you?” said Cho. 
He looked around and saw her watching him. 
“Yeah,” sighed Harry. “I do.” 
“Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third 
year?” she asked him. 
“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “You kept blocking me.” 
“And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my 
broom if you had to,” said Cho, smiling reminiscently. “I heard he got 
taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?” 
“Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw him at the World Cup last 
year.” 
“Oh, I saw you there too, remember? We were on the same camp-
site. It was really good, wasn’t it?” 
The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way 
down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe 
how easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking 
to Ron and Hermione, and he was just starting to feel confident and 
cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including 
Pansy Parkinson. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 558  
“Potter and Chang!” screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles. 
“Urgh, Chang, I don’t think much of your taste. . . . At least Diggory 
was good-looking!” 
They sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with 
many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embar-
rassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say 
about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet. 
“So . . . where d’you want to go?” Harry asked as they entered 
Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and 
down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on 
the pavements. 
“Oh . . . I don’t mind,” said Cho, shrugging. “Um . . . shall we just 
have a look in the shops or something?” 
They wandered toward Dervish and Banges. A large poster had 
been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at 
it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry 
found himself staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped 
Death Eaters. The poster (“By Order of the Ministry of Magic”) of-
fered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with infor-
mation relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured. 
“It’s funny, isn’t it,” said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the 
pictures of the Death Eaters. “Remember when that Sirius Black es-
caped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for 
him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren’t de-
mentors anywhere. . . .” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange’s 
face to glance up and down the High Street. “Yeah, it is weird. . . .” 
He was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he 
came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. They had not 
only let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for 
them. . . . It looked as though they really were outside Ministry con-
trol now. 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 559  
The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window 
he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold, 
heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry’s face and the back of his neck. 
“Um . . . d’you want to get a coffee?” said Cho tentatively, as the 
rain began to fall more heavily. 
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, looking around. “Where — ?” 
“Oh, there’s a really nice place just up here, haven’t you ever been 
to Madam Puddifoot’s?” she said brightly, and she led him up a side 
road and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before. It 
was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have 
been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly 
of Umbridge’s office. 
“Cute, isn’t it?” said Cho happily. 
“Er . . . yeah,” said Harry untruthfully. 
“Look, she’s decorated it for Valentine’s Day!” said Cho, indicating 
a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, 
circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants. 
“Aaah . . .” 
They sat down at the last remaining table, which was situated in 
the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, 
was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They 
were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, par-
ticularly when, looking around the tea shop, he saw that it was full of 
nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would 
expect him to hold her hand. 
“What can I get you, m’dears?” said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout 
woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and 
Roger Davies’s with great difficulty. 
“Two coffees, please,” said Cho. 
In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his 
girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they 
wouldn’t; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 560  
would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and 
tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he could not 
see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he had to look 
at Cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork 
and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering 
cherub. 
After a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge; 
Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy 
moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly 
canvassed during D.A. meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell 
again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from 
the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say. 
“Er . . . listen, d’you want to come with me to the Three Broom-
sticks at lunchtime? I’m meeting Hermione Granger there.” 
Cho raised her eyebrows. 
“You’re meeting Hermione Granger? Today?” 
“Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D’you want to 
come with me? She said it wouldn’t matter if you did.” 
“Oh . . . well . . . that was nice of her.” 
But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all; on 
the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather 
forbidding. 
A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his cof-
fee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Next door, Roger 
Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lips. 
Cho’s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee, and Harry was 
feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. Just do it, he told him-
self, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his 
chest. Just reach out and grab it. . . . Amazing how much more difficult 
it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than to 
snatch a speeding Snitch from midair . . . 
But just as he moved his hand forward, Cho took hers off the table. 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 561  
She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a 
mildly interested expression. 
“He asked me out, you know,” she said in a quiet voice. “A couple 
of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.” 
Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lung-
ing movement across the table, could not think why she was telling 
him this. If she wished she were sitting at the table next door being 
heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come out with 
him? 
He said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti 
over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had 
been about to drink. 
“I came in here with Cedric last year,” said Cho. 
In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, 
Harry’s insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted 
to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and 
a cherub floated over their heads. 
Cho’s voice was rather higher when she spoke again. 
“I’ve been meaning to ask you for ages. . . . Did Cedric — did he 
m-m-mention me at all before he died?” 
This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and 
least of all with Cho. 
“Well — no —” he said quietly. “There — there wasn’t time for 
him to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . d’you . . . d’you get to see a lot of 
Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?” 
His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw 
that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been af-
ter the last D.A. meeting before Christmas. 
“Look,” he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could 
overhear, “let’s not talk about Cedric right now. . . . Let’s talk about 
something else. . . .” 
But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE

“I thought,” she said, tears spattering down onto the table. “I 
thought you’d u-u-understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you 
n-need to talk about it t-too! I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn’t 
you?” 
Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies’ girl-
friend had even unglued herself to look around at Cho crying. 
“Well — I have talked about it,” Harry said in a whisper, “to Ron 
and Hermione, but —” 
“Oh, you’ll talk to Hermione Granger!” she said shrilly, her face 
now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart 
to stare. “But you won’t talk to me! P-perhaps it would be best if 
we just . . . just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione 
G-Granger, like you obviously want to!” 
Harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin 
and dabbed at her shining face with it. 
“Cho?” he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend 
and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho. 
“Go on, leave!” she said, now crying into the napkin. “I don’t know 
why you asked me out in the first place if you’re going to make 
arrangements to meet other girls right after me. . . . How many are 
you meeting after Hermione?” 
“It’s not like that!” said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally un-
derstanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he 
realized a split second too late was a mistake. 
Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet, and every-
body was watching them now. 
“I’ll see you around, Harry,” she said dramatically, and hiccuping 
slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open, and hurried off into 
the pouring rain. 
“Cho!” Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut 
behind her with a tuneful tinkle. 
There was total silence within the tea shop. Every eye was upon 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 563  
Harry. He threw a Galleon down onto the table, shook pink confetti 
out of his eyes, and followed Cho out of the door. 
It was raining hard now, and she was nowhere to be seen. He sim-
ply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had 
been getting along fine. 
“Women!” he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed 
street with his hands in his pockets. “What did she want to talk about 
Cedric for anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject 
that makes her act like a human hosepipe?” 
He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes 
he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew 
he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there 
would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening 
time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid 
was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose. 
“Hi, Hagrid!” he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed 
tables and pulled up a chair beside him. 
Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely rec-
ognized him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and sev-
eral new bruises. 
“Oh, it’s you, Harry,” said Hagrid. “You all righ’?” 
“Yeah, I’m fine,” lied Harry; in fact, next to this battered and 
mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he did not have much to complain 
about. “Er — are you okay?” 
“Me?” said Hagrid. “Oh yeah, I’m grand, Harry, grand. . . .” 
He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size 
of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry did not know what to say to him. 
They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said 
abruptly, “In the same boat, you an’ me, aren’ we, Harry?” 
“Er —” said Harry. 
“Yeah . . . I’ve said it before. . . . Both outsiders, like,” said Hagrid, 
nodding wisely. “An’ both orphans. Yeah . . . both orphans.” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 564  
He took a great swig from his tankard. 
“Makes a diff’rence, havin’ a decent family,” he said. “Me dad was 
decent. An’ your mum an’ dad were decent. If they’d lived, life woulda 
bin diff’rent, eh?” 
“Yeah . . . I s’pose,” said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in 
a very strange mood. 
“Family,” said Hagrid gloomily. “Whatever yeh say, blood’s im-
portant. . . .” 
And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye. 
“Hagrid,” said Harry, unable to stop himself, “where are you get-
ting all these injuries?” 
“Eh?” said Hagrid, looking startled. “Wha’ injuries?” 
“All those!” said Harry, pointing at Hagrid’s face. 
“Oh . . . tha’s jus’ normal bumps an’ bruises, Harry,” said Hagrid 
dismissively. “I got a rough job.” 
He drained his tankard, set it back upon the table, and got to his 
feet. 
“I’ll be seein’ yeh, Harry. . . . Take care now. . . .” 
And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disap-
peared into the torrential rain. Harry watched him go, feeling miser-
able. Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he 
seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But be-
fore Harry could think about the matter any further, he heard a voice 
calling his name. 
“Harry! Harry, over here!” 
Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He 
got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub. He 
was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not 
alone; she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking 
mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other 
than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of 
Hermione’s least favorite people in the world. 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 565  
“You’re early!” said Hermione, moving along to give him room to 
sit down. “I thought you were with Cho, I wasn’t expecting you for 
another hour at least!” 
“Cho?” said Rita at once, twisting around in her seat to stare avidly 
at Harry. “A girl ?” 
She snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it. 
“It’s none of your business if Harry’s been with a hundred girls,” 
Hermione told Rita coolly. “So you can put that away right now.” 
Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from 
her bag. Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap, 
she snapped her bag shut again. 
“What are you up to?” Harry asked, sitting down and staring from 
Rita to Luna to Hermione. 
“Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,” 
said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. “I suppose I’m allowed to 
talk to him, am I?” she shot at Hermione. 
“Yes, I suppose you are,” said Hermione coldly. 
Unemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set 
in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face. The 
scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a cou-
ple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. She took another 
great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, 
“Pretty girl, is she, Harry?” 
“One more word about Harry’s love life and the deal’s off and that’s 
a promise,” said Hermione irritably. 
“What deal?” said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. 
“You haven’t mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn 
up. Oh, one of these days . . .” She took a deep shuddering breath. 
“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll write more horrible stories about 
Harry and me,” said Hermione indifferently. “Find someone who 
cares, why don’t you?” 
“They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 566  
without my help,” said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the 
top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made 
you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?” 
“He feels angry, of course,” said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. 
“Because he’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s 
too much of an idiot to believe him.” 
“So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named is back?” said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to 
a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the 
crocodile bag. “You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore’s been 
telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the 
sole witness — ?” 
“I wasn’t the sole witness,” snarled Harry. “There were a dozen-odd 
Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?” 
“I’d love them,” breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more 
and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had 
ever seen. “A great bold headline: ‘Potter Accuses . . .’ A subheading: 
‘Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.’ And then, beneath a 
nice big photograph of you: ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-
Who’s attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing re-
spectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being 
Death Eaters. . . .’ ” 
The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to 
her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face. 
“But of course,” she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at 
Hermione, “Little Miss Perfect wouldn’t want that story out there, 
would she?” 
“As a matter of fact,” said Hermione sweetly, “that’s exactly what 
Little Miss Perfect does want.” 
Rita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang, 
“Weasley Is Our King” dreamily under her breath and stirred her 
drink with a cocktail onion on a stick. 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 567  
“You want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named?” Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice. 
“Yes, I do,” said Hermione. “The true story. All the facts. Exactly as 
Harry reports them. He’ll give you all the details, he’ll tell you the 
names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you 
what Voldemort looks like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,” she 
added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for at the 
sound of Voldemort’s name, Rita had jumped so badly that she had 
slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself. 
Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at 
Hermione. Then she said baldly, “The Prophet wouldn’t print it. In 
case you haven’t noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. 
Everyone thinks he’s delusional. Now, if you let me write the story 
from that angle —” 
“We don’t need another story about how Harry’s lost his marbles!” 
said Hermione angrily. “We’ve had plenty of those already, thank you! 
I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!” 
“There’s no market for a story like that,” said Rita coldly. 
“You mean the Prophet won’t print it because Fudge won’t let 
them,” said Hermione irritably. 
Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forward 
across the table toward her, she said in a businesslike tone, “All right, 
Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They 
won’t print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to 
read it. It’s against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has 
got people quite worried enough. People just don’t want to believe 
You-Know-Who’s back.” 
“So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, 
does it?” said Hermione scathingly. 
Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her 
glass of firewhisky. 
“The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,” she said coldly. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE 
 568  
“My dad thinks it’s an awful paper,” said Luna, chipping into the 
conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed 
at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eyes. “He pub-
lishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know. He 
doesn’t care about making money.” 
Rita looked disparagingly at Luna. 
“I’m guessing your father runs some stupid little village news-
letter?” she said. “ ‘Twenty-five Ways to Mingle with Muggles’ and 
the dates of the next Bring-and-Fly Sale?” 
“No,” said Luna, dipping her onion back into her gillywater, “he’s 
the editor of The Quibbler.” 
Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked around 
in alarm. 
“ ‘Important stories he thinks the public needs to know’?” she said 
witheringly. “I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag.” 
“Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn’t it?” said 
Hermione pleasantly. “Luna says her father’s quite happy to take 
Harry’s interview. That’s who’ll be publishing it.” 
Rita stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great 
whoop of laughter. 
“The Quibbler!” she said, cackling. “You think people will take him 
seriously if he’s published in The Quibbler?” 
“Some people won’t,” said Hermione in a level voice. “But the 
Daily Prophet’s version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping 
holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn’t 
a better explanation of what happened, and if there’s an alternative 
story available, even if it is published in a” — she glanced sideways at 
Luna, “in a — well, an unusual magazine — I think they might be 
rather keen to read it.” 
Rita did not say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, 
her head a little to one side. 
 
THE  BEETLE  AT  BAY 
 569  
“All right, let’s say for a moment I’ll do it,” she said abruptly. “What 
kind of fee am I going to get?” 
“I don’t think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the maga-
zine,” said Luna dreamily. “They do it because it’s an honor, and, of 
course, to see their names in print.” 
Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in 
her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione. “I’m supposed to do 
this for free?” 
“Well, yes,” said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. “Other-
wise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are 
an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you 
rather a lot for an insider’s account of life in Azkaban. . . .” 
Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to 
seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione’s drink and thrust 
it up her nose. 
“I don’t suppose I’ve got any choice, have I?” said Rita, her voice 
shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a 
piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill. 
“Daddy will be pleased,” said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in 
Rita’s jaw. 
“Okay, Harry?” said Hermione, turning to him. “Ready to tell the 
public the truth?” 
“I suppose,” said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-
Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them. 
“Fire away, then, Rita,” said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry 
out of the bottom of her glass.

una said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita’s interview 
with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was ex-
pecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned 
Snorkacks. “And, of course, that’ll be a very important story, so 
Harry’s might have to wait for the following issue,” said Luna. 
Harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night 
when Voldemort had returned. Rita had pressed him for every little 
detail, and he had given her everything he could remember, knowing 
that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth. He 
wondered how people would react to the story. He guessed that it 
would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely in-
sane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter 
rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. But the breakout of Bel-
latrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burn-
ing desire to do something, whether it worked or not. . . . 
“Can’t wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public,” said 
Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night. Seamus was  
 
L

 571  
shoveling down large amounts of chicken-and-ham pie on Dean’s 
other side, but Harry knew he was listening. 
“It’s the right thing to do, Harry,” said Neville, who was sitting op-
posite him. He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, “It must 
have been . . . tough . . . talking about it. . . . Was it?” 
“Yeah,” mumbled Harry, “but people have got to know what 
Voldemort’s capable of, haven’t they?” 
“That’s right,” said Neville, nodding, “and his Death Eaters too . . . 
People should know. . . .” 
Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato. 
Seamus looked up, but when he caught Harry’s eye he looked quickly 
back at his plate again. After a while Dean, Seamus, and Neville de-
parted for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the 
table waiting for Ron, who had not yet had dinner because of Quid-
ditch practice. 
Cho Chang walked into the hall with her friend Marietta. Harry’s 
stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but she did not look over at the 
Gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him. 
“Oh, I forgot to ask you,” said Hermione brightly, glancing over at 
the Ravenclaw table, “what happened on your date with Cho? How 
come you were back so early?” 
“Er . . . well, it was . . .” said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb 
crumble toward him and helping himself to seconds, “a complete fi-
asco, now you mention it.” 
And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot’s Tea 
Shop. 
“. . . so then,” he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of 
crumble disappeared, “she jumps up, right, and says ‘I’ll see you 
around, Harry,’ and runs out of the place!” He put down his spoon 
and looked at Hermione. “I mean, what was all that about? What was 
going on?” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 572  
Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho’s head and sighed. “Oh, 
Harry,” she said sadly. “Well, I’m sorry, but you were a bit tactless.” 
“Me, tactless?” said Harry, outraged. “One minute we were getting 
on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her 
out, and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea 
shop — how was I supposed to feel about that?” 
“Well, you see,” said Hermione, with the patient air of one ex-
plaining that one plus one equals two to an overemotional toddler, 
“you shouldn’t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway 
through your date.” 
“But, but,” spluttered Harry, “but — you told me to meet you at 
twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without 
telling her — ?” 
“You should have told her differently” said Hermione, still with 
that maddeningly patient air. “You should have said it was really an-
noying, but I’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broom-
sticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the 
whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought 
to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and 
hopefully you’d be able to get away more quickly? And it might have 
been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too,” Hermi-
one added as an afterthought. 
“But I don’t think you’re ugly,” said Harry, bemused. 
Hermione laughed. 
“Harry, you’re worse than Ron. . . . Well, no, you’re not,” she 
sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with 
mud and looking grumpy. “Look — you upset Cho when you said 
you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was 
her way of trying to find out how much you liked her.” 
“Is that what she was doing?” said Harry as Ron dropped onto the 
bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach toward him-

self. “Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if she’d just asked me whether 
I liked her better than you?” 
“Girls don’t often ask questions like that,” said Hermione. 
“Well, they should!” said Harry forcefully. “Then I could’ve just 
told her I fancy her, and she wouldn’t have had to get herself all 
worked up again about Cedric dying!” 
“I’m not saying what she did was sensible,” said Hermione, as 
Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally dis-
gruntled. “I’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the 
time.” 
“You should write a book,” Ron told Hermione as he cut up his 
potatoes, “translating mad things girls do so boys can understand 
them.” 
“Yeah,” said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table. 
Cho had just got up; still not looking at him, she left the Great Hall. 
Feeling rather depressed, he looked back at Ron and Ginny. “So, how 
was Quidditch practice?” 
“It was a nightmare,” said Ron in a surly voice. 
“Oh come on,” said Hermione, looking at Ginny, “I’m sure it 
wasn’t that —” 
“Yes, it was,” said Ginny. “It was appalling. Angelina was nearly in 
tears by the end of it.” 
Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner; Harry and Her-
mione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual 
pile of homework. Harry had been struggling with a new star chart for 
Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up. 
“Ron and Ginny not here?” asked Fred, looking around as he 
pulled up a chair and, when Harry shook his head, he said, “Good. 
We were watching their practice. They’re going to be slaughtered. 
They’re complete rubbish without us.” 
“Come on, Ginny’s not bad,” said George fairly, sitting down next  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 574  
to Fred. “Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never 
let her play with us. . . .” 
“She’s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the 
age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you 
weren’t looking,” said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of An-
cient Rune books. 
“Oh,” said George, looking mildly impressed. “Well — that’d ex-
plain it.” 
“Has Ron saved a goal yet?” asked Hermione, peering over the top 
of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms. 
“Well, he can do it if he doesn’t think anyone’s watching him,” said 
Fred, rolling his eyes. “So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn 
their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up 
his end on Saturday.” 
He got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out 
across the dark grounds. 
“You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth 
staying for.” 
Hermione cast him a stern look. 
“You’ve got exams coming!” 
“Told you already, we’re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s,” said Fred. 
“The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of 
those boils, just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them, Lee 
put us onto it. . . .” 
George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy 
night sky. 
“I dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith 
beats us I might have to kill myself.” 
“Kill him, more like,” said Fred firmly. 
“That’s the trouble with Quidditch,” said Hermione absentmind-
edly, once again bent over her Rune translation, “it creates all this bad 
feeling and tension between the Houses.” 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 575  
She looked up to find her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary and caught 
Fred, George, and Harry looking at her with expressions of mingled 
disgust and incredulity on their faces. 
“Well, it does!” she said impatiently. “It’s only a game, isn’t it?” 
“Hermione,” said Harry, shaking his head, “you’re good on feelings 
and stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch.” 
“Maybe not,” she said darkly, returning to her translation again, “but 
at least my happiness doesn’t depend on Ron’s goalkeeping ability.” 
And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy 
Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the 
following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not 
to care about Quidditch either. 
The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was 
short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two min-
utes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry 
thought it was a close-run contest between Ron’s fourteenth failed save, 
Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his 
bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom as Zacha-
rias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that 
Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch 
from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby’s nose, so that the final 
score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty. 
“Good catch,” Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where 
the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral. 
“I was lucky,” she shrugged. “It wasn’t a very fast Snitch and Sum-
merby’s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong 
moment. Anyway, once you’re back on the team —” 
“Ginny, I’ve got a lifelong ban.” 
“You’re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,” Ginny cor-
rected him. “There’s a difference. Anyway, once you’re back, I think 
I’ll try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year 
and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 576  
Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at 
his knees, a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand. 
“Angelina still won’t let him resign,” Ginny said, as though reading 
Harry’s mind. “She says she knows he’s got it in him.” 
Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at 
the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the 
team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of “Weasley 
Is Our King” sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now 
favorites to win the Quidditch Cup. 
Fred and George wandered over. 
“I haven’t got the heart to take the mickey out of him, even,” said 
Fred, looking over at Ron’s crumpled figure. “Mind you . . . when he 
missed the fourteenth . . .” 
He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright 
doggy-paddle. 
“Well, I’ll save it for parties, eh?” 
Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for 
his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory 
himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to. Sure 
enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little 
too loudly to be entirely plausible. 
Harry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been im-
mensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite im-
pressed by Ginny’s performance but he felt that if he had been playing 
he could have caught the Snitch sooner. . . . There had been a mo-
ment when it had been fluttering near Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hes-
itated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor. . . . 
Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione. 
Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him, her 
wide toad’s mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating 
smile. The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there

in the dark. After a few minutes, however, he remembered that he was 
supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept, as 
Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson. 
He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of 
memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling re-
sentment, and he found himself focusing instead on how much he 
loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Ron’s snores died away, replaced by 
the sound of deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get 
to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close 
down. 
He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing 
around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall 
played the bagpipes. He watched them happily for a while, then de-
cided to go and find the other members of the D.A. . . . 
But when he left the room he found himself facing, not the tapes-
try of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a 
stone wall. He turned his head slowly to the left. There, at the far end 
of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door. 
He walked toward it with a sense of mounting excitement. He had 
the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last, 
and find the way to open it. . . . He was feet from it and saw with a 
leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light 
down the right-hand side. . . . The door was ajar. . . . He stretched 
out his hand to push it wide and — 
Ron gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore, and Harry awoke abruptly 
with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness, to open 
a door that was hundreds of miles away. He let it fall with a feeling of 
mingled disappointment and guilt. He knew he should not have seen 
the door, but at the same time, felt so consumed with curiosity about 
what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron. 
. . . If he could have saved his snore for just another minute . . .

They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment 
as the post owls on Monday morning. Hermione was not the only 
person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: Nearly everyone was eager 
for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many re-
ported sightings, had still not been caught. She gave the delivery owl 
a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped him-
self to orange juice; as he had only received one note during the entire 
year he was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of 
him, that it had made a mistake. 
“Who’re you after?” he asked it, languidly removing his orange 
juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipi-
ent’s name and address: 
 
Harry Potter 
Great Hall 
Hogwarts School 
 
Frowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he 
could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it 
and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter, knocking over 
the salt, and each attempting to give him their letters first. 
“What’s going on?” Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of 
Gryffindor table leaned forward to watch as another seven owls 
landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting, and flapping their 
wings. 
“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the 
feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical 
package. “I think I know what this means — open this one first!” 
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled 
copy of March’s edition of The Quibbler. He unrolled it to see his own 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 579  
face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red let-
ters across his picture were the words: 
 
HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: 
THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED 
AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN 
 
“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna, who had drifted over to the 
Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself onto the bench between 
Fred and Ron. “It came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free 
copy. I expect all these,” she waved a hand at the assembled owls still 
scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry, “are letters from 
readers.” 
“That’s what I thought,” said Hermione eagerly, “Harry, d’you 
mind if we — ?” 
“Help yourself,” said Harry, feeling slightly bemused. 
Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes. 
“This one’s from a bloke who thinks you’re off your rocker,” said 
Ron, glancing down his letter. “Ah well . . .” 
“This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at 
St. Mungo’s,” said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling 
up a second. 
“This one looks okay, though,” said Harry slowly, scanning a long 
letter from a witch in Paisley. “Hey, she says she believes me!” 
“This one’s in two minds,” said Fred, who had joined in the letter-
opening with enthusiasm. “Says you don’t come across as a mad per-
son, but he really doesn’t want to believe You-Know-Who’s back so he 
doesn’t know what to think now. . . . Blimey, what a waste of parch-
ment . . .” 
“Here’s another one you’ve convinced, Harry!” said Hermione ex-
citedly. “ ‘Having read your side of the story I am forced to the con-
clusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly. . . . Little 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 580  
though I want to think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has re-
turned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth. . . .’ Oh 
this is wonderful!” 
“Another one who thinks you’re barking,” said Ron, throwing a 
crumpled letter over his shoulder, “but this one says you’ve got her 
converted, and she now thinks you’re a real hero — she’s put in a pho-
tograph too — wow —” 
“What is going on here?” said a falsely sweet, girlish voice. 
Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes. Professor Um-
bridge was standing behind Fred and Luna, her bulging toad’s eyes 
scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry. 
Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly. 
“Why have you got all these letters, Mr. Potter?” she asked slowly. 
“Is that a crime now?” said Fred loudly. “Getting mail?” 
“Be careful, Mr. Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention,” 
said Umbridge. “Well, Mr. Potter?” 
Harry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had 
done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The 
Quibbler came to Umbridge’s attention. 
“People have written to me because I gave an interview,” said 
Harry. “About what happened to me last June.” 
For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this. He 
had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a 
second before, but when he looked, Dumbledore seemed to be ab-
sorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick. 
“An interview?” repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher 
than ever. “What do you mean?” 
“I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,” said 
Harry. “Here —” 
And he threw the copy of The Quibbler at her. She caught it and 
stared down at the cover. Her pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy 
violet. 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 581  
“When did you do this?” she asked, her voice trembling slightly. 
“Last Hogsmeade weekend,” said Harry. 
She looked up at him, incandescent with rage, the magazine shak-
ing in her stubby fingers. 
“There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr. Potter,” she 
whispered. “How you dare . . . how you could . . .” She took a deep 
breath. “I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies. The 
message, apparently, has still not sunk in. Fifty points from Gryffin-
dor and another week’s worth of detentions.” 
She stalked away, clutching The Quibbler to her chest, the eyes of 
many students following her. 
By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the 
school, not just on House notice boards, but in the corridors and class-
rooms too. 
—  by order of  — 
The High Inquisitor of Hogwarts 
Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quib-
bler will be expelled. 
The above is in accordance with 
Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven. 
Signed: 
 
 
high inquisitor 
 
 
For some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these 
signs she beamed with pleasure. 
“What exactly are you so happy about?” Harry asked her. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 582  
“Oh Harry, don’t you see?” Hermione breathed. “If she could have 
done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this 
school will read your interview, it was banning it!” 
And it seemed that Hermione was quite right. By the end of that 
day, though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler 
anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the in-
terview at each other; Harry heard them whispering about it as they 
queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of 
lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cu-
bicles in the girls’ toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in 
there before Ancient Runes. 
“And then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, 
so they were bombarding me with questions,” Hermione told Harry, 
her eyes shining, “and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do, I 
think you’ve finally got them convinced!” 
Meanwhile Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping 
students at random and demanding that they turn out their books 
and pockets. Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler, 
but the students were several steps ahead of her. The pages carrying 
Harry’s interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from text-
books if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank 
until they wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every single 
person in the school had read it. 
The teachers were, of course, forbidden from mentioning the in-
terview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found 
ways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout 
awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering 
can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar 
mice on him at the end of Charms, said “Shh!” and hurried away; and 
Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and 
announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, 
that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 583  
live to a ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have twelve 
children. 
But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as 
he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before he knew 
what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his 
ear, “I’m really, really sorry. That interview was so brave . . . it made 
me cry.” 
He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very 
glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when 
she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again. And un-
believably, no sooner had he arrived outside Transfiguration than 
something just as good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to 
face him. 
“I just wanted to say,” he mumbled, squinting at Harry’s left knee, 
“I believe you. And I’ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.” 
If anything more was needed to complete Harry’s happiness, it was 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s reactions. He saw them with their heads 
together later that afternoon in the library, together with a weedy-
looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott. They 
looked around at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he 
needed on Partial Vanishment, and Goyle cracked his knuckles threat-
eningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to 
Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: He 
had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters. 
“And the best bit is,” whispered Hermione gleefully as they left the 
library, “they can’t contradict you, because they can’t admit they’ve 
read the article!” 
To cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no copy of The Quib-
bler had ever sold out faster. 
“Dad’s reprinting!” she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly. “He 
can’t believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than 
the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 584  
Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night; dar-
ingly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front 
cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry’s giant 
head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things 
like “The Ministry are morons” and “Eat dung, Umbridge” in a 
booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it 
interfered with her concentration, and ended up going to bed early 
out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as 
funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had 
started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like 
“Dung” and “Umbridge” at more and more frequent intervals in a 
progressively higher voice. In fact it started to make his head ache and 
his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans 
from the many people who were sitting around him, asking him to re-
live his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too 
needed an early night. 
The dormitory was empty when he reached it. He rested his fore-
head for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his 
bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into 
bed, wishing his headache would go away. He also felt slightly sick. 
He rolled over onto his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at 
once. . . . 
He was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of 
candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of 
him. They were long-fingered and white as though they had not seen 
sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders against the dark 
velvet of the chair. 
Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the can-
dles, knelt a man in black robes. 
“I have been badly advised, it seems,” said Harry, in a high, cold 
voice that pulsed with anger. 
“Master, I crave your pardon. . . .” croaked the man kneeling on 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 585  
the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He 
seemed to be trembling. 
“I do not blame you, Rookwood,” said Harry in that cold, cruel 
voice. 
He relinquished his grip upon the chair and walked around it, 
closer to the man cowering upon the floor, until he stood directly over 
him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than 
usual. 
“You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?” asked Harry. 
“Yes, My Lord, yes . . . I used to work in the department after — 
after all. . . .” 
“Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.” 
“Bode could never have taken it, Master. . . . Bode would have 
known he could not. . . . Undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard 
against Malfoy’s Imperius Curse. . . .” 
“Stand up, Rookwood,” whispered Harry. 
The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was 
pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. He 
remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a 
bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry’s face. 
“You have done well to tell me this,” said Harry. “Very well . . . I 
have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems. . . . But no matter 
. . . We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort’s gratitude, 
Rookwood. . . .” 
“My Lord . . . yes, My Lord,” gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse 
with relief. 
“I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give 
me.” 
“Of course, My Lord, of course . . . anything . . .” 
“Very well . . . you may go. Send Avery to me.” 
Rookwood scurried backward, bowing, and disappeared through a 
door. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 586  
Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned toward the wall. A 
cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Harry 
moved toward it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness. 
. . . A face whiter than a skull . . . red eyes with slits for pupils . . . 
“NOOOOOOOOO!” 
“What?” yelled a voice nearby. 
Harry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and 
fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was; 
he was convinced that he was about to see the white, skull-like face 
looming at him out of the dark again, then Ron’s voice spoke very 
near to him. 
“Will you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you out of here!” 
Ron wrenched the hangings apart, and Harry stared up at him in 
the moonlight, as he lay flat on his back, his scar searing with pain. 
Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm 
was out of his robes. 
“Has someone been attacked again?” asked Ron, pulling Harry 
roughly to his feet. “Is it Dad? Is it that snake?” 
“No — everyone’s fine —” gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as 
though it was on fire again. “Well . . . Avery isn’t. . . . He’s in trouble. 
. . . He gave him the wrong information. . . . He’s really angry. . . .” 
Harry groaned and sank, shaking, onto his bed, rubbing his scar. 
“But Rookwood’s going to help him now. . . . He’s on the right 
track again. . . .” 
“What are you talking about?” said Ron, sounding scared. “D’you 
mean . . . did you just see You-Know-Who?” 
“I was You-Know-Who,” said Harry, and he stretched out his 
hands in the darkness and held them up to his face to check that they 
were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. “He was with Rook-
wood, he’s one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, re-
member? Rookwood’s just told him Bode couldn’t have done it. . . .” 
 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 587  
“Done what?” 
“Remove something. . . . He said Bode would have known he 
couldn’t have done it. . . . Bode was under the Imperius Curse. . . . I 
think he said Malfoy’s dad put it on him. . . .” 
“Bode was bewitched to remove something?” Ron said. “But — 
Harry, that’s got to be —” 
“The weapon,” Harry finished the sentence for him. “I know.” 
The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry 
swung his legs back into bed. He did not want to look as though any-
thing odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped 
thinking Harry was a nutter. 
“Did you say,” murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry’s on 
the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside 
table, “that you were You-Know-Who?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry quietly. 
Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water. Harry saw it spill 
over his chin onto his chest. 
“Harry,” he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, 
pulling off their robes, and talking, “you’ve got to tell —” 
“I haven’t got to tell anyone,” said Harry shortly. “I wouldn’t have 
seen it at all if I could do Occlumency. I’m supposed to have learned 
to shut this stuff out. That’s what they want.” 
By “they” he meant Dumbledore. He got back into bed and rolled 
over onto his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron’s 
mattress creak as he lay back down too. His scar began to burn; he bit 
hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise. Somewhere, he 
knew, Avery was being punished. . . . 
 
Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione ex-
actly what had happened. They wanted to be absolutely sure they 
could not be overheard. Standing in their usual corner of the cool and  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 588  
breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could 
remember. When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few 
moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and 
George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from 
under their cloaks on the other side of the yard. 
“So that’s why they killed him,” she said quietly, withdrawing her 
gaze from Fred and George at last. “When Bode tried to steal this 
weapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be 
defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people from touching it. 
That’s why he was in St. Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he 
couldn’t talk. But remember what the Healer told us? He was recov-
ering. And they couldn’t risk him getting better, could they? I mean, 
the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon prob-
ably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his voice back, he’d 
explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would have known 
he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy 
for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, 
is he?” 
“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said 
Harry. “In the — hang on . . .” he said slowly. “He was in the De-
partment of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said he was proba-
bly trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, 
but what if —” 
“Sturgis,” gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck. 
“Sorry?” said Ron, looking bewildered. 
“Sturgis Podmore,” said Hermione, breathlessly. “Arrested for try-
ing to get through a door. Lucius Malfoy got him too. I bet he did it 
the day you saw him there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody’s Invisibility 
Cloak, right? So what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible, 
and Malfoy heard him move, or guessed he was there, or just did the 
Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there? So when 
Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it was his turn on 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 589  
guard duty again — he tried to get into the department to steal the 
weapon for Voldemort — Ron, be quiet — but he got caught and 
sent to Azkaban. . . .” 
She gazed at Harry. 
“And now Rookwood’s told Voldemort how to get the weapon?” 
“I didn’t hear all the conversation, but that’s what it sounded like,” 
said Harry. “Rookwood used to work there. . . . Maybe Voldemort’ll 
send Rookwood to do it?” 
Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite 
abruptly, she said, “But you shouldn’t have seen this at all, Harry.” 
“What?” he said, taken aback. 
“You’re supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort 
of thing,” said Hermione, suddenly stern. 
“I know I am,” said Harry. “But —” 
“Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,” said 
Hermione firmly. “And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your 
Occlumency from now on.” 
Harry was so angry with her that he did not talk to her for the rest 
of the day, which proved to be another bad one. When people were 
not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors today, they 
were laughing at Gryffindor’s abysmal performance in their match 
against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing “Weasley Is Our King” 
so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from 
the corridors out of sheer irritation. 
The week did not improve as it progressed: Harry received two 
more D’s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get 
the sack, and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in 
which he had seen Voldemort, though he did not bring it up with Ron 
and Hermione again because he did not want another telling-off from 
Hermione. He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius 
about it, but that was out of the question, so he tried to push the mat-
ter to the back of his mind. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 590  
Unfortunately, the back of his mind was no longer the secure place 
it had once been. 
“Get up, Potter.” 
A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be 
found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape’s office, trying to clear 
his head. He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very 
early memories he had not even realized he still had, most of them 
concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him 
in primary school. 
“That last memory,” said Snape. “What was it?” 
“I don’t know,” said Harry, getting wearily to his feet. He was find-
ing it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the 
rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. “You mean 
the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?” 
“No,” said Snape softly. “I mean the one concerning a man kneel-
ing in the middle of a darkened room. . . .” 
“It’s . . . nothing,” said Harry. 
Snape’s dark eyes bored into Harry’s. Remembering what Snape 
had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry 
blinked and looked away. 
“How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, 
Potter?” said Snape. 
“It —” said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, “it was — just 
a dream I had.” 
“A dream,” repeated Snape. 
There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead 
frog suspended in a purple liquid in its jar. 
“You do know why we are here, don’t you, Potter?” said Snape in a 
low, dangerous voice. “You do know why I am giving up my evenings 
to this tedious job?” 
“Yes,” said Harry stiffly. 
“Remind me why we are here, Potter.” 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 591  
“So I can learn Occlumency,” said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel. 
“Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be” — Harry looked 
back at Snape, hating him — “I would have thought that after two 
months’ worth of lessons you might have made some progress. How 
many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?” 
“Just that one,” lied Harry. 
“Perhaps,” said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, “per-
haps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. 
Maybe they make you feel special — important?” 
“No, they don’t,” said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched 
tightly around the handle of his wand. 
“That is just as well, Potter,” said Snape coldly, “because you are 
neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what 
the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.” 
“No — that’s your job, isn’t it?” Harry shot at him. 
He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper. For 
a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced he had 
gone too far. But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on 
Snape’s face when he answered. 
“Yes, Potter,” he said, his eyes glinting. “That is my job. Now, if you 
are ready, we will start again. . . .” 
He raised his wand. “One — two — three — Legilimens!” 
A hundred dementors were swooping toward Harry across the lake 
in the grounds. . . . He screwed up his face in concentration. . . . 
They were coming closer. . . . He could see the dark holes beneath 
their hoods . . . yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him, 
his eyes fixed upon Harry’s face, muttering under his breath. . . . And 
somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the dementors were grow-
ing fainter . . . 
Harry raised his own wand. 
“Protego!” 
Snape staggered; his wand flew upward, away from Harry — and 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 592  
suddenly Harry’s mind was teeming with memories that were not 
his — a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a 
small dark-haired boy cried in a corner. . . . A greasy-haired teenager 
sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shoot-
ing down flies. . . . A girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to 
mount a bucking broomstick — 
“ENOUGH!” 
Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he took 
several staggering steps backward, hit some of the shelves covering 
Snape’s walls and heard something crack. Snape was shaking slightly, 
very white in the face. 
The back of Harry’s robes were damp. One of the jars behind him 
had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was 
swirling in its draining potion. 
“Reparo!” hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself once more. “Well, 
Potter . . . that was certainly an improvement. . . .” Panting slightly, 
Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of 
his thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though checking that 
they were still there. “I don’t remember telling you to use a Shield 
Charm . . . but there is no doubt that it was effective. . . .” 
Harry did not speak; he felt that to say anything might be danger-
ous. He was sure he had just broken into Snape’s memories, that he had 
just seen scenes from Snape’s childhood, and it was unnerving to think 
that the crying little boy who had watched his parents shouting was ac-
tually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes. . . . 
“Let’s try again, shall we?” said Snape. 
Harry felt a thrill of dread: He was about to pay for what had just 
happened, he was sure of it. They moved back into position with the 
desk between them, Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder 
to empty his mind this time. . . . 
“On the count of three, then,” said Snape, raising his wand once 
more. “One — two —”

Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to 
clear his mind, for Snape had already cried “Legilimens!” 
He was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mys-
teries, past the blank stone walls, past the torches — the plain black 
door was growing ever larger; he was moving so fast he was going to 
collide with it, he was feet from it and he could see that chink of faint 
blue light again — 
The door had flown open! He was through it at last, inside a black-
walled, black-floored circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and 
there were more doors all around him — he needed to go on — but 
which door ought he to take — ? 
“POTTER!” 
Harry opened his eyes. He was flat on his back again with no 
memory of having gotten there; he was also panting as though he re-
ally had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really 
had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room. . . . 
“Explain yourself!” said Snape, who was standing over him, look-
ing furious. 
“I . . . dunno what happened,” said Harry truthfully, standing up. 
There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the 
ground and he felt feverish. “I’ve never seen that before. I mean, I told 
you, I’ve dreamed about the door . . . but it’s never opened before. . . .” 
“You are not working hard enough!” 
For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two 
minutes before, when Harry had seen into his own memories. 
“You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark 
Lord —” 
“Can you tell me something, sir?” said Harry, firing up again. 
“Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve only ever heard 
Death Eaters call him that —” 
Snape opened his mouth in a snarl — and a woman screamed from 
somewhere outside the room. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 594  
Snape’s head jerked upward; he was gazing at the ceiling. 
“What the — ?” he muttered. 
Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he 
thought might be the entrance hall. Snape looked around at him, 
frowning. 
“Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?” 
Harry shook his head. Somewhere above them, the woman 
screamed again. Snape strode to his office door, his wand still held at 
the ready, and swept out of sight. Harry hesitated for a moment, then 
followed. 
The screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall; they grew 
louder as Harry ran toward the stone steps leading up from the dun-
geons. When he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed. 
Students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was 
still in progress, to see what was going on. Others had crammed them-
selves onto the marble staircase. Harry pushed forward through a knot 
of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, 
some of them looking shocked, others even frightened. Professor 
McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the hall; 
she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly 
sick. 
Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall 
with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other, 
looking utterly mad. Her hair was sticking up on end, her glasses were 
lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other; her in-
numerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her 
shoulders, giving the impression that she was falling apart at the 
seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them up-
side down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down 
the stairs after her. Professor Trelawney was staring, apparently terri-
fied, at something Harry could not see but that seemed to be standing 
at the foot of the stairs. 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 595  
“No!” she shrieked. “NO! This cannot be happening. . . . It cannot 
. . . I refuse to accept it!” 
“You didn’t realize this was coming?” said a high girlish voice, 
sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to his right, 
saw that Trelawney’s terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor 
Umbridge. “Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow’s 
weather, you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance 
during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it 
inevitable you would be sacked?” 
“You c-can’t!” howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down 
her face from behind her enormous lenses, “you c-can’t sack me! I’ve 
b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!” 
“It was your home,” said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was re-
volted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched 
Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, onto one of her 
trunks, “until an hour ago, when the Minister of Magic countersigned 
the order for your dismissal. Now kindly remove yourself from this 
hall. You are embarrassing us.” 
But she stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoy-
ment, as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned, rocking back-
ward and forward on her trunk in paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a 
sob to his left and looked around. Lavender and Parvati were both cry-
ing silently, their arms around each other. Then he heard footsteps. 
Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched 
straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the 
back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes. 
“There, there, Sibyll . . . Calm down. . . . Blow your nose on this. 
. . . It’s not as bad as you think, now. . . . You are not going to have to 
leave Hogwarts. . . .” 
“Oh really, Professor McGonagall?” said Umbridge in a deadly 
voice, taking a few steps forward. “And your authority for that state-
ment is . . . ?” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX 
 596  
“That would be mine,” said a deep voice. 
The oak front doors had swung open. Students beside them scut-
tled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. What he 
had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but 
there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the 
doorway against an oddly misty night. Leaving the doors wide behind 
him, he strode forward through the circle of onlookers toward the 
place where Professor Trelawney sat, tearstained and trembling, upon 
her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her. 
“Yours, Professor Dumbledore?” said Umbridge with a singularly 
unpleasant little laugh. “I’m afraid you do not understand the posi-
tion. I have here” — she pulled a parchment scroll from within her 
robes — “an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister of 
Magic. Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, 
the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon 
probation, and sack any teacher she — that is to say, I — feel is not 
performing up to the standard required by the Ministry of Magic. I 
have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch. I have dis-
missed her.” 
To Harry’s very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He 
looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and chok-
ing on her trunk, and said, “You are quite right, of course, Professor 
Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my 
teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to send them away 
from the castle. I am afraid,” he went on, with a courteous little bow, 
“that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster, and it is 
my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts.” 
At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hic-
cup was barely hidden. 
“No — no, I’ll g-go, Dumbledore! I sh-shall l-leave Hogwarts and 
s-seek my fortune elsewhere —” 
 
SEEN  AND  UNFORESEEN 
 597  
“No,” said Dumbledore sharply. “It is my wish that you remain, 
Sibyll.” 
He turned to Professor McGonagall. 
“Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs, Professor 
McGonagall?” 
“Of course,” said McGonagall. “Up you get, Sibyll. . . .” 
Professor Sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and 
grabbed Professor Trelawney’s other arm. Together they guided her 
past Umbridge and up the marble stairs. Professor Flitwick went scur-
rying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked, “Loco-
motor trunks!” and Professor Trelawney’s luggage rose into the air and 
proceeded up the staircase after her, Professor Flitwick bringing up the 
rear. 
Professor Umbridge was standing stock-still, staring at Dumble-
dore, who continued to smile benignly. 
“And what,” she said in a whisper that nevertheless carried all 
around the entrance hall, “are you going to do with her once I appoint 
a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings?” 
“Oh, that won’t be a problem,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. “You 
see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he will pre-
fer lodgings on the ground floor.” 
“You’ve found — ?” said Umbridge shrilly. “You’ve found? Might I 
remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Twenty-
two —” 
“— the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if — 
and only if — the headmaster is unable to find one,” said Dumble-
dore. “And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded. 
May I introduce you?” 
He turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist 
was now drifting. Harry heard hooves. There was a shocked murmur 
around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther

backward, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for 
the newcomer. 
Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a 
dark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and 
astonishingly blue eyes, the head and torso of a man joined to the 
palomino body of a horse. 
“This is Firenze,” said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck 
Umbridge. “I think you’ll find him suitable.”

’ll bet you wish you hadn’t given up Divination now, don’t you, 
Hermione?” asked Parvati, smirking. 
It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor 
Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and 
examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their 
first lesson with Firenze that morning. 
“Not really,” said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the 
Daily Prophet. “I’ve never really liked horses.” 
She turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns. 
“He’s not a horse, he’s a centaur!” said Lavender, sounding shocked. 
“A gorgeous centaur . . .” sighed Parvati. 
“Either way, he’s still got four legs,” said Hermione coolly. “Any-
way, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone?” 
“We are!” Lavender assured her. “We went up to her office to see 
her, we took her some daffodils — not the honking ones that Sprout’s 
got, nice ones. . . .” 
“How is she?” asked Harry. 
“Not very good, poor thing,” said Lavender sympathetically. “She

CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 600  
was crying and saying she’d rather leave the castle forever than stay 
here if Umbridge is still here, and I don’t blame her. Umbridge was 
horrible to her, wasn’t she?” 
“I’ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,” 
said Hermione darkly. 
“Impossible,” said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs 
and bacon. “She can’t get any worse than she’s been already.” 
“You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore 
for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,” said Hermione, 
closing the newspaper. “Especially another part-human. You saw the 
look on her face when she saw Firenze. . . .” 
After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class and 
Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the entrance hall, 
heading for Divination. 
“Aren’t we going up to North Tower?” asked Ron, looking puzzled, 
as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase. 
Parvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him. 
“How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We’re in class-
room eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.” 
Classroom eleven was situated in the ground-floor corridor leading 
off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry 
knew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly, 
and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or 
storeroom. When he entered it right behind Ron, and found him-
self right in the middle of a forest clearing, he was therefore momen-
tarily stunned. 
“What the — ?” 
The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were 
growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and 
windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled, 
green light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on the 
earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 601  
arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests, 
looking rather nervous. In the middle of the room, where there were 
no trees, stood Firenze. 
“Harry Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered. 
“Er — hi,” said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who sur-
veyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did 
not smile. “Er — good to see you . . .” 
“And you,” said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head. “It 
was foretold that we would meet again.” 
Harry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise 
on Firenze’s chest. As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the 
floor, he saw that they were all looking at him with awe, apparently 
deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom 
they seemed to find intimidating. 
When the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon 
a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around 
the room. 
“Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,” 
said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, “in imitation of my 
natural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden 
Forest, which was — until Monday — my home . . . but this is not 
possible.” 
“Please — er — sir —” said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand, 
“why not? We’ve been in there with Hagrid, we’re not frightened!” 
“It is not a question of your bravery,” said Firenze, “but of my po-
sition. I can no longer return to the forest. My herd has banished me.” 
“Herd?” said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she 
was thinking of cows. “What — oh!” Comprehension dawned on her 
face. “There are more of you?” she said, stunned. 
“Did Hagrid breed you, like the thestrals?” asked Dean eagerly. 
Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to 
realize at once that he had said something very offensive. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 602  
“I didn’t — I meant — sorry,” he finished in a hushed voice. 
“Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,” said 
Firenze quietly. There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again. 
“Please, sir . . . why have the other centaurs banished you?” 
“Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,” said 
Firenze. “They see this as a betrayal of our kind.” 
Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane 
had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon his 
back, calling him a “common mule.” He wondered whether it had 
been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest. 
“Let us begin,” said Firenze. He swished his long palomino tail, 
raised his hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it 
slowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they 
now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars 
emerged upon the ceiling. There were oohs and gasps, and Ron said 
audibly, “Blimey!” 
“Lie back upon the floor,” said Firenze in his calm voice, “and ob-
serve the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune 
of our races.” 
Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upward at the ceiling. A 
twinkling red star winked at him from overhead. 
“I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their 
moons in Astronomy,” said Firenze’s calm voice, “and that you have 
mapped the stars’ progress through the heavens. Centaurs have unrav-
eled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings 
teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us. . . .” 
“Professor Trelawney did Astrology with us!” said Parvati excitedly, 
raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay 
on her back. “Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that, 
and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now” — she drew a right 
angle in the air above her — “that means that people need to be extra 
careful when handling hot things —” 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 603  
“That,” said Firenze calmly, “is human nonsense.” 
Parvati’s hand fell limply to her side. 
“Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,” said Firenze, as his hooves 
thudded over the mossy floor. “These are of no more significance than 
the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by 
planetary movements.” 
“Professor Trelawney —” began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant 
voice. 
“— is a human,” said Firenze simply. “And is therefore blinkered 
and fettered by the limitations of your kind.” 
Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati. She looked very 
offended, as did several of the people surrounding her. 
“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued 
Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up 
and down before them, “but she wastes her time, in the main, on the 
self-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, however, am 
here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and im-
partial. We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are 
sometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we 
are seeing.” 
Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry. 
“In the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is 
living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars. 
Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the 
fight must break out again soon. How soon, centaurs may attempt to 
divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation 
of fume and flame. . . .” 
It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did 
indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and 
Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pun-
gent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of 
them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 604  
were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to 
become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to 
put too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs 
sometimes read them wrongly. He was nothing like any human 
teacher Harry had ever had. His priority did not seem to be to teach 
them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, 
not even centaurs’ knowledge, was foolproof. 
“He’s not very definite on anything, is he?” said Ron in a low voice, 
as they put out their mallowsweet fire. “I mean, I could do with a few 
more details about this war we’re about to have, couldn’t you?” 
The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone 
jumped; Harry had completely forgotten that they were still inside the 
castle, quite convinced that he was really in the forest. The class filed 
out, looking slightly perplexed; Harry and Ron were on the point of 
following them when Firenze called, “Harry Potter, a word, please.” 
Harry turned. The centaur advanced a little toward him. Ron 
hesitated. 
“You may stay,” Firenze told him. “But close the door, please.” 
Ron hastened to obey. 
“Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid’s, are you not?” said the 
centaur. 
“Yes,” said Harry. 
“Then give him a warning from me. His attempt is not working. 
He would do better to abandon it.” 
“His attempt is not working?” Harry repeated blankly. 
“And he would do better to abandon it,” said Firenze, nodding. “I 
would warn Hagrid myself, but I am banished — it would be unwise 
for me to go too near the forest now — Hagrid has troubles enough, 
without a centaurs’ battle.” 
“But — what’s Hagrid attempting to do?” said Harry nervously. 
Firenze looked at Harry impassively. 
“Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,” said Firenze, 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 605  
“and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all liv-
ing creatures. I shall not betray his secret. But he must be brought to 
his senses. The attempt is not working. Tell him, Harry Potter. Good 
day to you.” 
 
The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler inter-
view had long since evaporated. As a dull March blurred into a squally 
April, his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and 
problems again. 
Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures 
lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to Ha-
grid. At last Harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy 
of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after 
class one day. When he passed on Firenze’s message, Hagrid gazed at 
him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken 
aback. Then he seemed to pull himself together. 
“Nice bloke, Firenze,” he said gruffly, “but he don’ know what he’s 
talkin’ abou’ on this. The attemp’s comin’ on fine.” 
“Hagrid, what’re you up to?” asked Harry seriously. “Because 
you’ve got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and 
if you ask me, she’s on a roll. If you’re doing anything you shouldn’t 
be —” 
“There’s things more importan’ than keepin’ a job,” said Hagrid, 
though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl 
droppings crashed to the floor. “Don’ worry abou’ me, Harry, jus’ get 
along now, there’s a good lad. . . .” 
Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all 
over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up 
to the castle. 
Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding 
them, the O.W.L.s were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth years were 
suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 606  
first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she 
burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid 
to take exams and wanted to leave school now. 
If it had not been for the D.A. lessons, Harry thought he would 
have been extremely unhappy. He sometimes felt that he was living 
for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but 
thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as 
he looked around at his fellow D.A. members and saw how far they 
had come. Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was 
going to react when all the members of the D.A. received “Outstand-
ing” in their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.s. 
They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had 
been very keen to practice, though as Harry kept reminding them, 
producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when 
they were not under threat was very different to producing it when 
confronted by something like a dementor. 
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her sil-
very swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement 
during their last lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!” 
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect 
you,” said Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or some-
thing; that’s how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the bog-
gart was pretending to be a dementor —” 
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting 
puffs of silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still — 
can’t — do it!” she added angrily. 
Neville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concen-
tration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip. 
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him. 
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his 
round face was actually shining with sweat. 
“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 607  
brought along to his first ever D.A. meeting by Dean. “Look — ah — 
it’s gone. . . . But it was definitely something hairy, Harry!” 
Hermione’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around 
her. 
“They are sort of nice, aren’t they?” she said, looking at it fondly. 
The door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed 
again; Harry looked around to see who had entered, but there did not 
seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before he realized 
that the people close to the door had fallen silent. Next thing he knew, 
something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee. He 
looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the 
house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight hats. 
“Hi, Dobby!” he said. “What are you — what’s wrong?” 
For the elf’s eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking. The 
members of the D.A. closest to Harry had fallen silent now: Every-
body in the room was watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people 
had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room 
looking much darker than before. 
“Harry Potter, sir . . .” squeaked the elf, trembling from head to 
foot, “Harry Potter, sir . . . Dobby has come to warn you . . . but the 
house-elves have been warned not to tell . . .” 
He ran headfirst at the wall: Harry, who had some experience of 
Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby 
merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats. Hermione 
and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy. 
“What’s happened, Dobby?” Harry asked, grabbing the elf’s tiny 
arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek 
to hurt himself. 
“Harry Potter . . . she . . . she . . .” 
Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist: Harry seized 
that too. 
“Who’s ‘she,’ Dobby?” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 608  
But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce 
such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and 
mouthed wordlessly. 
“Umbridge?” asked Harry, horrified. 
Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry’s knees; 
Harry held him at bay. 
“What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — 
about us — about the D.A.?” 
He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by 
Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor. 
“Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly. 
Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the 
floor. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!” 
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terri-
fied people gazing at the thrashing elf. 
“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!” 
They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the 
door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting 
along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make 
it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just 
took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer — 
“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot 
of people now fighting to get out. 
He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself seri-
ous injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the 
queue. 
“Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with 
the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say 
no!” said Harry. “And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, drop-
ping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the 
door behind him. 
“Thank you, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off.

Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that he 
caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor be-
fore they vanished. He started to run right; there was a boys’ bath-
room up ahead, he could pretend he’d been in there all the time if he 
could just reach it — 
“AAARGH!” 
Something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly, 
skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt. Some-
one behind him was laughing. He rolled over onto his back and saw 
Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase. 
“Trip Jinx, Potter!” he said. “Hey, Professor — PROFESSOR! I’ve 
got one!” 
Umbridge came bustling around the far corner, breathless but 
wearing a delighted smile. 
“It’s him!” she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. “Ex-
cellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good — fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll 
take him from here. . . . Stand up, Potter!” 
Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. He had never seen 
Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and 
turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy. “You hop along and see if you 
can round up anymore of them, Draco,” she said. “Tell the others to 
look in the library — anybody out of breath — check the bathrooms, 
Miss Parkinson can do the girls’ ones — off you go — and you,” she 
added in her softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away. 
“You can come with me to the headmaster’s office, Potter.” 
They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered 
how many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron — Mrs. 
Weasley would kill him — and of how Hermione would feel if she 
was expelled before she could take her O.W.L.s. And it had been Sea-
mus’s very first meeting . . . and Neville had been getting so good. . . . 
“Fizzing Whizbee,” sang Umbridge, and the stone gargoyle jumped 
aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone

staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but 
Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still 
holding tight to Harry. 
The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind his 
desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Pro-
fessor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense. 
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was rocking backward and for-
ward on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with 
the situation. Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard Harry 
did not recognize with very short, wiry hair were positioned on either 
side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of 
Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy 
scroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes. 
The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not sham-
ming sleep tonight. All of them were watching what was happening 
below, alert and serious. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neigh-
boring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors’ ears. 
Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge’s grasp as the door swung 
shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of 
vicious satisfaction upon his face. 
“Well,” he said. “Well, well, well . . .” 
Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart 
drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear. 
“He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Umbridge. There 
was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure 
Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with 
misery in the entrance hall. “The Malfoy boy cornered him.” 
“Did he, did he?” said Fudge appreciatively. “I must remember to 
tell Lucius. Well, Potter . . . I expect you know why you are here?” 
Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant “yes”: His mouth 
had opened and the word was half formed when he caught sight of  
 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 611  
Dumbledore’s face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry; 
his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder, but as Harry 
stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side. 
Harry changed direction mid-word. 
“Yeh — no.” 
“I beg your pardon?” said Fudge. 
“No,” said Harry, firmly. 
“You don’t know why you are here?” 
“No, I don’t,” said Harry. 
Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge; 
Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another 
quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods 
and the shadow of a wink. 
“So you have no idea,” said Fudge in a voice positively sagging with 
sarcasm, “why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You 
are not aware that you have broken any school rules?” 
“School rules?” said Harry. “No.” 
“Or Ministry decrees?” amended Fudge angrily. 
“Not that I’m aware of,” said Harry blandly. 
His heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling 
these lies to watch Fudge’s blood pressure rising, but he could not see 
how on earth he would get away with them. If somebody had tipped 
off Umbridge about the D.A. then he, the leader, might as well be 
packing his trunk right now. 
“So it’s news to you, is it,” said Fudge, his voice now thick with 
anger, “that an illegal student organization has been discovered within 
this school?” 
“Yes, it is,” said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent 
surprise onto his face. 
“I think, Minister,” said Umbridge silkily from beside him, “we 
might make better progress if I fetch our informant.” 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 612  
“Yes, yes, do,” said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at 
Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. “There’s nothing like a good 
witness, is there, Dumbledore?” 
“Nothing at all, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his 
head. 
There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at 
each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge 
moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho’s curly-
haired friend Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands. 
“Don’t be scared, dear, don’t be frightened,” said Professor Um-
bridge softly, patting her on the back, “it’s quite all right, now. You 
have done the right thing. The minister is very pleased with you. He’ll 
be telling your mother what a good girl you’ve been. Marietta’s mother, 
Minister,” she added, looking up at Fudge, “is Madam Edgecombe 
from the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network of-
fice — she’s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.” 
“Jolly good, jolly good!” said Fudge heartily. “Like mother, like 
daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don’t be shy, let’s 
hear what you’ve got to — galloping gargoyles!” 
As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly 
landing himself in the fire. He cursed and stamped on the hem of his 
cloak, which had started to smoke, and Marietta gave a wail and 
pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before the 
whole room had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series 
of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks 
to form the word “SNEAK.” 
“Never mind the spots now, dear,” said Umbridge impatiently, “just 
take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister —” 
But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head 
frantically. 
“Oh, very well, you silly girl, I’ll  tell him,” snapped Umbridge. She 
hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, “Well, Minister, 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 613  
Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this 
evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. She 
said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, some-
times known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out some-
thing to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she 
admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortu-
nately at that point this hex,” she waved impatiently at Marietta’s con-
cealed face, “came into operation and upon catching sight of her face 
in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.” 
“Well, now,” said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently 
imagined was a kind and fatherly look. “It is very brave of you, my 
dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge, you did exactly the right 
thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What 
was its purpose? Who was there?” 
But Marietta would not speak. She merely shook her head again, 
her eyes wide and fearful. 
“Haven’t we got a counterjinx for this?” Fudge asked Umbridge 
impatiently, gesturing at Marietta’s face. “So she can speak freely?” 
“I have not yet managed to find one,” Umbridge admitted grudg-
ingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione’s jinxing ability. 
“But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from 
here. 
“You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in Oc-
tober that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog’s 
Head in Hogsmeade —” 
“And what is your evidence for that?” cut in Professor McGonagall. 
“I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who hap-
pened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, 
but his hearing was quite unimpaired,” said Umbridge smugly. “He 
heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to re-
port to me —” 
“Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 614  
regurgitating toilets!” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eye-
brows. “What an interesting insight into our justice system!” 
“Blatant corruption!” roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-
nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk. “The Ministry 
did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!” 
“Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,” said Dumbledore softly. 
“The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students,” continued 
Professor Umbridge, “was to persuade them to join an illegal society, 
whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are 
inappropriate for school-age —” 
“I think you’ll find you’re wrong there, Dolores,” said Dumbledore 
quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway 
down his crooked nose. 
Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going 
to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard 
every word he said in the Hog’s Head there was simply no escaping it. 
“Oho!” said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet 
again. “Yes, do let’s hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull 
Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on — Willy 
Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter’s identical twin in the 
Hog’s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involv-
ing a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of 
invisible dementors?” 
Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh. 
“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!” 
Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, 
that Dumbledore was smiling gently too. 
“Cornelius, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does Harry — 
that he was in the Hog’s Head that day, nor that he was trying to re-
cruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely 
pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group 
was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree ban-
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 615  
ning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after 
Harry’s Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules in the 
Hog’s Head at all.” 
Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something 
very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth 
hanging open. 
Umbridge recovered first. 
“That’s all very fine, Headmaster,” she said, smiling sweetly. “But 
we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational 
Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all 
those that have happened since most certainly are.” 
“Well,” said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over 
the top of his interlocked fingers, “they certainly would  be, if they had  
continued after the decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence 
that these meetings continued?” 
As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather 
thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that 
he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a 
draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there. 
“Evidence?” repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike 
smile. “Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think 
Miss Edgecombe is here?” 
“Oh, can she tell us about six months’ worth of meetings?” said 
Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. “I was under the impression that 
she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.” 
“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these 
meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your 
head, I’m sure that won’t make the spots worse. Have they been hap-
pening regularly over the last six months?” 
Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they 
had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would 
be able to shift aside. . . . 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 616  
“Just nod or shake your head, dear,” Umbridge said coaxingly to 
Marietta. “Come on, now, that won’t activate the jinx further. . . .” 
Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face. Only 
her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe. 
Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank. 
And then — to Harry’s utter amazement — Marietta shook her head. 
Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta. 
“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I’m ask-
ing whether you’ve been going to these meetings for the past six 
months? You have, haven’t you?” 
Again, Marietta shook her head. 
“What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?” said Umbridge 
in a testy voice. 
“I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,” said Professor 
McGonagall harshly. “There have been no secret meetings for the past 
six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?” 
Marietta nodded. 
“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously. 
“There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the 
Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter 
organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl ?” 
“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall 
coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of 
sign language as yet unknown to humans —” 
Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her, 
and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was 
on his feet, his wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge 
leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they 
had been burned. 
“I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,” said 
Dumbledore, and for the first time, he looked angry. 
“You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,” said Kingsley in 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 617  
his deep, slow voice. “You don’t want to get yourself into trouble 
now.” 
“No,” said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering fig-
ure of Kingsley. “I mean, yes — you’re right, Shacklebolt — I — I 
forgot myself.” 
Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her. 
She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge’s sudden attack, nor re-
lieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly 
blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion con-
nected to Kingsley’s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him 
sprang into Harry’s mind. 
“Dolores,” said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something 
once and for all, “the meeting tonight — the one we know definitely 
happened —” 
“Yes,” said Umbridge, pulling herself together, “yes . . . well, Miss 
Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh 
floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch 
those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned 
of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor 
they were running in every direction. It does not matter, however. I 
have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Re-
quirement for me to see if they had left anything behind. . . . We 
needed evidence and the room provided . . .” 
And to Harry’s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of 
names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement’s wall 
and handed it to Fudge. 
“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were 
dealing with,” she said softly. 
“Excellent,” said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face. “Excel-
lent, Dolores. And . . . by thunder . . .” 
He looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Mari-
etta, his wand held loosely in his hand. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 618  
“See what they’ve named themselves?” said Fudge quietly. “Dum-
bledore’s Army.” 
Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from 
Fudge. He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months be-
fore and for a moment seemed unable to speak. Then he looked up, 
smiling. 
“Well, the game is up,” he said simply. “Would you like a written 
confession from me, Cornelius — or will a statement before these 
witnesses suffice?” 
Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was 
fear in both faces. He did not understand what was going on, and nei-
ther, apparently, did Fudge. 
“Statement?” said Fudge slowly. “What — I don’t — ?” 
“Dumbledore’s Army, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, still smiling as 
he waved the list of names before Fudge’s face. “Not Potter’s Army. 
Dumbledore’s Army.” 
“But — but —” 
Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudge’s face. He took a horrified 
step backward, yelped, and jumped out of the fire again. 
“You?” he whispered, stamping again on his smoldering cloak. 
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. 
“You organized this?” 
“I did,” said Dumbledore. 
“You recruited these students for — for your army?” 
“Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,” said Dumbledore, 
nodding. “Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining 
me. I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of 
course.” 
Marietta nodded. Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest 
swelling. 
“Then you have been plotting against me!” he yelled. 
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 619  
“NO!” shouted Harry. 
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened 
her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon Harry what 
Dumbledore was about to do, and he could not let it happen. 
“No — Professor Dumbledore!” 
“Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,” 
said Dumbledore calmly. 
“Yes, shut up, Potter!” barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumble-
dore with a kind of horrified delight. “Well, well, well — I came here 
tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead —” 
“Instead you get to arrest me,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It’s like 
losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn’t it?” 
“Weasley!” cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight, 
“Weasley, have you written it all down, everything he’s said, his con-
fession, have you got it?” 
“Yes, sir, I think so, sir!” said Percy eagerly, whose nose was splat-
tered with ink from the speed of his note-taking. 
“The bit about how he’s been trying to build up an army against 
the Ministry, how he’s been working to destabilize me?” 
“Yes, sir, I’ve got it, yes!” said Percy, scanning his notes joyfully. 
“Very well, then,” said Fudge, now radiant with glee. “Duplicate 
your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once. If 
we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition!” Percy 
dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him, and Fudge 
turned back to Dumbledore. “You will now be escorted back to the 
Ministry, where you will be formally charged and then sent to Azka-
ban to await trial!” 
“Ah,” said Dumbledore gently, “yes. Yes, I thought we might hit 
that little snag.” 
“Snag?” said Fudge, his voice still vibrating with joy. “I see no snag, 
Dumbledore!” 
“Well,” said Dumbledore apologetically, “I’m afraid I do.” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 620  
“Oh really?” 
“Well — it’s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion 
that I am going to — what is the phrase? ‘Come quietly’ I am afraid I 
am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have absolutely no 
intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course — 
but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of 
things I would rather be doing.” 
Umbridge’s face was growing steadily redder, she looked as though 
she was being filled with boiling water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore 
with a very silly expression on his face, as though he had just been 
stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had hap-
pened. He made a small choking noise and then looked around at 
Kingsley and the man with short gray hair, who alone of everyone in 
the room had remained entirely silent so far. The latter gave Fudge a 
reassuring nod and moved forward a little, away from the wall. Harry 
saw his hand drift, almost casually, toward his pocket. 
“Don’t be silly, Dawlish,” said Dumbledore kindly. “I’m sure you 
are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Out-
standing’ in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to — er — ‘bring 
me in’ by force, I will have to hurt you.” 
The man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish. He looked 
toward Fudge again, but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to 
what to do next. 
“So,” sneered Fudge, recovering himself, “you intend to take on 
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you, 
Dumbledore?” 
“Merlin’s beard, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “Not unless you 
are foolish enough to force me to.” 
“He will not be single-handed!” said Professor McGonagall loudly, 
plunging her hand inside her robes. 
“Oh yes he will, Minerva!” said Dumbledore sharply. “Hogwarts 
needs you!” 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 621  
“Enough of this rubbish!” said Fudge, pulling out his own wand. 
“Dawlish! Shacklebolt! Take him!” 
A streak of silver light flashed around the room. There was a bang 
like a gunshot, and the floor trembled. A hand grabbed the scruff of 
Harry’s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash 
went off — several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a 
cloud of dust filled the air. Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark fig-
ure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him. There was a shriek 
and a thud and somebody cried, “No!” Then the sound of breaking 
glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan — and silence. 
Harry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw 
Professor McGonagall crouched beside him. She had forced both him 
and Marietta out of harm’s way. Dust was still floating gently down 
through the air onto them. Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall fig-
ure moving toward them. 
“Are you all right?” said Dumbledore. 
“Yes!” said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry 
and Marietta with her. 
The dust was clearing. The wreckage of the office loomed into 
view: Dumbledore’s desk had been overturned, all of the spindly ta-
bles had been knocked to the floor, their silver instruments in pieces. 
Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley, and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor. 
Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them, singing softly. 
“Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked 
very suspicious,” said Dumbledore in a low voice. “He was remark-
ably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe’s memory like 
that while everyone was looking the other way — thank him for me, 
won’t you, Minerva? 
“Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do 
not know that we had time to communicate — you must act as though 
no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked to the 
ground, they will not remember —” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN 
 622  
“Where will you go, Dumbledore?” whispered Professor McGona-
gall. “Grimmauld Place?” 
“Oh no,” said Dumbledore with a grim smile. “I am not leaving to 
go into hiding. Fudge will soon wish he’d never dislodged me from 
Hogwarts, I promise you. . . .” 
“Professor Dumbledore . . .” Harry began. 
He did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had 
started the D.A. in the first place and caused all this trouble, or how 
terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expul-
sion? But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word. 
“Listen to me, Harry,” he said urgently, “you must study Occlu-
mency as hard as you can, do you understand me? Do everything Pro-
fessor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before 
sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams — you will 
understand why soon enough, but you must promise me —” 
The man called Dawlish was stirring. Dumbledore seized Harry’s 
wrist. 
“Remember — close your mind —” 
But as Dumbledore’s fingers closed over Harry’s skin, a pain shot 
through the scar on his forehead, and he felt again that terrible, snake-
like longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him — 
“— you will understand,” whispered Dumbledore. 
Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore 
released Harry, raised his hand, and grasped the phoenix’s long golden 
tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone. 
“Where is he?” yelled Fudge, pushing himself up from the ground. 
“Where is he?” 
“I don’t know!” shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his feet. 
“Well, he can’t have Disapparated!” cried Umbridge. “You can’t in-
side this school —” 
“The stairs!” cried Dawlish, and he flung himself upon the door, 
wrenched it open, and disappeared, followed closely by Kingsley and 
THE  CENTAUR  AND 
THE  SNEAK 
 623  
Umbridge. Fudge hesitated, then got to his feet slowly, brushing dust 
from his front. There was a long and painful silence. 
“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirt-
sleeve, “I’m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore.” 
“You think so, do you?” said Professor McGonagall scornfully. 
Fudge seemed not to hear her. He was looking around at the 
wrecked office. A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even 
made rude hand gestures. 
“You’d better get those two off to bed,” said Fudge, looking back at 
Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod toward Harry and 
Marietta. 
She said nothing, but marched Harry and Marietta to the door. As 
it swung closed behind them, Harry heard Phineas Nigellus’s voice. 
“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts 
. . . but you cannot deny he’s got style. . . .”

Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Al-

The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did 
not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know 
SNAPE’S  WORST

that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the 
Minister of Magic, and his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter 
where Harry went within the castle next day, the sole topic of conver-
sation was Dumbledore’s flight, and though some of the details might 
have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl 
assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo’s with a 
pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their 
information was. Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that Harry 
and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in 
Dumbledore’s office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, 
Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a firsthand ac-
count wherever he went. 
“Dumbledore will be back before long,” said Ernie Macmillan con-
fidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to 
Harry’s story. “They couldn’t keep him away in our second year and 
they won’t be able to this time. The Fat Friar told me . . .” He dropped 
his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to 
lean closer to him to hear, “. . . that Umbridge tried to get back into his 
office last night after they’d searched the castle and grounds for him. 
Couldn’t get past the gargoyle. The Head’s office has sealed itself against 
her.” Ernie smirked. “Apparently she had a right little tantrum. . . .” 
“Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head’s 
office,” said Hermione viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into 
the entrance hall. “Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid 
puffed-up, power-crazy old —” 
“Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?” 
Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, followed by 
Crabbe and Goyle. His pale, pointed face was alight with malice. 
“Afraid I’m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and 
Hufflepuff,” he drawled. 
“It’s only teachers that can dock points from Houses, Malfoy,” said 
Ernie at once. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 626  
“Yeah, we’re prefects too, remember?” snarled Ron. 
“I know prefects can’t dock points, Weasel King,” sneered Malfoy; 
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. “But members of the Inquisitorial 
Squad —” 
“The what?” said Hermione sharply. 
“The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,” said Malfoy, pointing toward a 
tiny silver I upon his robes just beneath his prefect’s badge. “A select 
group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-
picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial 
Squad do have the power to dock points. . . . So, Granger, I’ll have five 
from you for being rude about our new headmistress. . . . Macmillan, 
five for contradicting me. . . . Five because I don’t like you, Potter . . . 
Weasley, your shirt’s untucked, so I’ll have another five for that. . . . Oh 
yeah, I forgot, you’re a Mudblood, Granger, so ten for that. . . .” 
Ron pulled out his wand, but Hermione pushed it away, whisper-
ing, “Don’t!” 
“Wise move, Granger,” breathed Malfoy. “New Head, new times 
. . . Be good now, Potty . . . Weasel King . . .” 
He strode away, laughing heartily with Crabbe and Goyle. 
“He was bluffing,” said Ernie, looking appalled. “He can’t be al-
lowed to dock points . . . that would be ridiculous. . . . It would com-
pletely undermine the prefect system. . . .” 
But Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned automatically toward 
the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which 
recorded the House points. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck 
and neck in the lead that morning. Even as they watched, stones flew 
upward, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs. In fact, the only 
glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin. 
“Noticed, have you?” said Fred’s voice. 
He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie in front of the hourglasses. 
“Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,” said Harry furiously, 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 627  
as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor 
hourglass. 
“Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,” said George. 
“What do you mean, ‘tried’?” said Ron quickly. 
“He never managed to get all the words out,” said Fred, “due to the 
fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the 
first floor.” 
Hermione looked very shocked. 
“But you’ll get into terrible trouble!” 
“Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I 
dunno where we sent him,” said Fred coolly. “Anyway . . . we’ve de-
cided we don’t care about getting into trouble anymore.” 
“Have you ever?” asked Hermione. 
“ ’Course we have,” said George. “Never been expelled, have we?” 
“We’ve always known where to draw the line,” said Fred. 
“We might have put a toe across it occasionally,” said George. 
“But we’ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem,” said 
Fred. 
“But now?” said Ron tentatively. 
“Well, now —” said George. 
“— what with Dumbledore gone —” said Fred. 
“— we reckon a bit of mayhem —” said George. 
“— is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,” said Fred. 
“You mustn’t!” whispered Hermione. “You really mustn’t! She’d 
love a reason to expel you!” 
“You don’t get it, Hermione, do you?” said Fred, smiling at her. 
“We don’t care about staying anymore. We’d walk out right now if we 
weren’t determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first. So anyway,” he 
checked his watch, “phase one is about to begin. I’d get in the Great 
Hall for lunch if I were you, that way the teachers will see you can’t 
have had anything to do with it.” 
“Anything to do with what?” said Hermione anxiously. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 628  
“You’ll see,” said George. “Run along, now.” 
Fred and George turned away and disappeared in the swelling 
crowd descending the stairs toward lunch. Looking highly discon-
certed, Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration 
homework and scurried away. 
“I think we should get out of here, you know,” said Hermione ner-
vously. “Just in case . . .” 
“Yeah, all right,” said Ron, and the three of them moved toward the 
doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed today’s ceiling 
of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoul-
der and, turning, he found himself almost nose to nose with Filch, the 
caretaker. He took several hasty steps backward; Filch was best viewed 
at a distance. 
“The headmistress would like to see you, Potter,” he leered. 
“I didn’t do it,” said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and 
George were planning. Filch’s jowls wobbled with silent laughter. 
“Guilty conscience, eh?” he wheezed. “Follow me. . . .” 
Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione, who were both looking 
worried. He shrugged and followed Filch back into the entrance hall, 
against the tide of hungry students. 
Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creak-
ily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they 
reached the first landing he said, “Things are changing around here, 
Potter.” 
“I’ve noticed,” said Harry coldly. 
“Yerse . . . I’ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he’s too 
soft with you all,” said Filch, chuckling nastily. “You filthy little beasts 
would never have dropped Stinkpellets if you’d known I had it in my 
power to whip you raw, would you, now? Nobody would have 
thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could’ve 
strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they? But when Edu-
cational Decree Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I’ll be allowed to do 
SNAPE’S  WORST

 629  
them things. . . . And she’s asked the Minister to sign an order for the 
expulsion of Peeves. . . . Oh, things are going to be very different 
around here with her in charge. . . .” 
Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her 
side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably 
prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school’s secret pas-
sageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley 
twins. 
“Here we are,” he said, leering down at Harry as he rapped three 
times upon Professor Umbridge’s door and pushed it open. “The Pot-
ter boy to see you, ma’am.” 
Umbridge’s office, so very familiar to Harry from his many deten-
tions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying 
across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word 
HEADMISTRESS; also his Firebolt, and Fred’s and George’s Clean-
sweeps, which he saw with a pang were now chained and padlocked to 
a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk. Umbridge was sitting be-
hind the desk, busily scribbling upon some of her pink parchment, 
but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance. 
“Thank you, Argus,” she said sweetly. 
“Not at all, ma’am, not at all,” said Filch, bowing as low as his 
rheumatism would permit, and exiting backward. 
“Sit,” said Umbridge curtly, pointing toward a chair, and Harry sat. 
She continued to scribble for a few moments. He watched some of the 
foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head, wondering 
what fresh horror she had in store for him. 
“Well now,” she said finally, setting down her quill and looking 
like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. “What would you 
like to drink?” 
“What?” said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her. 
“To drink, Mr. Potter,” she said, smiling still more widely. “Tea? 
Coffee? Pumpkin juice?” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 630  
As she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a 
cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk. 
“Nothing, thank you,” said Harry. 
“I wish you to have a drink with me,” she said, her voice becoming 
more dangerously sweet. “Choose one.” 
“Fine . . . tea then,” said Harry, shrugging. 
She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her 
back to him. She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in sin-
isterly sweet fashion. 
“There,” she said, handing it to him. “Drink it before it gets cold, 
won’t you? Well, now, Mr. Potter . . . I thought we ought to have a lit-
tle chat, after the distressing events of last night.” 
He said nothing. She settled herself back into her seat and waited. 
When several long moments had passed in silence, she said gaily, 
“You’re not drinking up!” 
He raised the cup to his lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered it. 
One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round 
blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody’s magical one, and it had just oc-
curred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry 
had drunk anything offered by a known enemy. 
“What’s the matter?” said Umbridge, who was still watching him. 
“Do you want sugar?” 
“No,” said Harry. 
He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, 
though keeping his mouth tightly closed. Umbridge’s smile widened. 
“Good,” she whispered. “Very good. Now then . . .” She leaned 
forward a little. “Where is Albus Dumbledore?” 
“No idea,” said Harry promptly. 
“Drink up, drink up,” she said, still smiling. “Now, Mr. Potter, let 
us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone. 
You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. 
Consider your position, Mr. Potter. . . .” 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 631  
“I don’t know where he is.” 
Harry pretended to drink again. 
“Very well,” said Umbridge, looking displeased. “In that case, you 
will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.” 
Harry’s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup 
shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his 
mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid 
trickled down onto his robes. 
“I don’t know,” he said a little too quickly. 
“Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, “let me remind you that it was I who 
almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I 
know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any 
proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, 
Mr. Potter . . . Where is Sirius Black?” 
“No idea,” said Harry loudly. “Haven’t got a clue.” 
They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering. 
Then she stood up. 
“Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be 
warned: The might of the Ministry stands behind me. All channels of 
communication in and out of this school are being monitored. A Floo 
Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts — 
except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and 
reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Mr. Filch is 
observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred 
of evidence . . .” 
BOOM! 
The very floor of the office shook; Umbridge slipped sideways, 
clutching her desk for support, looking shocked. 
“What was — ?” 
She was gazing toward the door; Harry took the opportunity to 
empty his almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers. 
He could hear people running and screaming several floors below. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 632  
“Back to lunch with you, Potter!” cried Umbridge, raising her 
wand and dashing out of the office. Harry gave her a few seconds’ start 
then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was. 
It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned. 
Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what 
seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks. 
Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring 
up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as 
they went. Shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were 
whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets 
with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls. 
Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Fire-
crackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and in-
stead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a 
halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and 
momentum the longer he watched. 
Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed with hor-
ror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger 
Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more 
room to maneuver; it whirled toward Umbridge and Filch with a sin-
ister wheeeeeeeeee. Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and it 
soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the 
grounds. Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that 
was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end 
of the corridor to escape toward the second floor. 
“Hurry, Filch, hurry!” shrieked Umbridge. “They’ll be all over the 
school unless we do something — Stupefy!” 
A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the 
rockets. Instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that 
it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle 
of a meadow — she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later  
 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 633  
squashed into the painting next door, where a couple of wizards play-
ing cards stood up hastily to make room for her. 
“Don’t Stun them, Filch!” shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the 
world as though it had been his suggestion. 
“Right you are, Headmistress!” wheezed Filch, who was a Squib 
and could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them. 
He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swat-
ting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom 
was ablaze. 
Harry had seen enough. Laughing, he ducked down low, ran to a 
door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the 
corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just 
behind it, listening to Umbridge’s and Filch’s yells and quaking with 
suppressed mirth. 
“Impressive,” Harry said quietly, grinning. “Very impressive . . . 
You’ll put Dr. Filibuster out of business, no problem. . . .” 
“Cheers,” whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face. 
“Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next. . . . They multiply by ten 
every time you try. . . .” 
The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school 
that afternoon. Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly 
the firecrackers, the other teachers did not seem to mind them very 
much. 
“Dear, dear,” said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the 
dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhal-
ing flame. “Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the head-
mistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our 
classroom?” 
The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first af-
ternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the 
summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 634  
their rooms of the fireworks without her. When the final bell rang and 
the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags, 
Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a disheveled and soot-blackened 
Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick’s classroom. 
“Thank you so much, Professor!” said Professor Flitwick in his 
squeaky little voice. “I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of 
course, but I wasn’t sure whether I had the authority. . . .” 
Beaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face. 
Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common 
room. Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd 
around them to congratulate them. 
“They were wonderful fireworks,” she said admiringly. 
“Thanks,” said George, looking both surprised and pleased. 
“Weasleys’ Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. Only thing is, we used our whole 
stock, we’re going to have to start again from scratch now. . . .” 
“It was worth it, though,” said Fred, who was taking orders from 
clamoring Gryffindors. “If you want to add your name to the waiting 
list, Hermione, it’s five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty 
for the Deflagration Deluxe. . . .” 
Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting 
staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might 
spring out of it and start doing itself. 
“Oh, why don’t we have a night off?” said Hermione brightly, as a 
silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window. “After all, the 
Easter holidays start on Friday, we’ll have plenty of time then. . . .” 
“Are you feeling all right?” Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief. 
“Now you mention it,” said Hermione happily, “d’you know . . . I 
think I’m feeling a bit . . . rebellious.” 
Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when 
he and Ron went up to bed an hour later, and as he got undressed a 
sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word 
POO. 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 635  
He got into bed, yawning. With his glasses off, the occasional fire-
work still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling 
clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky. He turned 
onto his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first 
day in Dumbledore’s job, and how Fudge would react when he heard 
that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced dis-
ruption. . . . Smiling to himself, he closed his eyes. . . . 
The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed 
to be growing more distant . . . or perhaps he, Harry, was simply 
speeding away from them. . . . 
He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of 
Mysteries. He was speeding toward the plain black door. . . . Let it  
open. . . . Let it open. . . . 
It did. He was inside the circular room lined with doors. . . . He 
crossed it, placed his hand upon an identical door, and it swung 
inward. . . . 
Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd, mechanical 
clicking. There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did 
not pause to investigate. . . . He had to go on. . . . 
There was a door at the far end. . . . It too opened at his touch. . . . 
And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, 
full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden 
with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres. . . . Now Harry’s heart was 
beating fast with excitement. . . . He knew where to go. . . . He ran 
forward, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted 
room. . . . 
There was something in this room he wanted very, very much. . . . 
Something he wanted. . . . or somebody else wanted. . . . 
His scar was hurting. . . . 
BANG! Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dor-
mitory was full of the sound of laughter. 
“Cool!” said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 636  
“I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it’s like they 
mated, come and see!” 
Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look. 
He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and dis-
appointment washed over him. He felt as though a wonderful treat 
had been snatched from him at the very last moment. . . . He had got 
so close that time. . . . 
Glittering, pink-and-silver winged piglets were now soaring past 
the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the ap-
preciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His 
stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlu-
mency the following evening. . . . 
 
Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going 
to say if he found out how much farther into the Department of Mys-
teries he had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he 
realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last 
lesson: There had been too much going on since Dumbledore had 
left. He was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even 
if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept 
that excuse. . . . 
He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, 
but it was no good, Hermione kept asking him what was wrong 
whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emo-
tion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while 
teachers were firing review questions at the class. 
Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape’s office after dinner. 
Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to 
him. 
“Over here,” said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting 
with Snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall 
where the giant hourglasses stood. Gryffindor’s was now almost 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 637  
empty. “Are you okay? Umbridge hasn’t been asking you about the 
D.A., has she?” 
“Oh no,” said Cho hurriedly. “No, it was only . . . Well, I just 
wanted to say . . . Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell. . . .” 
“Yeah, well,” said Harry moodily. He did feel Cho might have cho-
sen her friends a bit more carefully. It was small consolation that the 
last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and 
Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improve-
ment to her pimples. 
“She’s a lovely person really,” said Cho. “She just made a 
mistake —” 
Harry looked at her incredulously. 
“A lovely person who made a mistake? She sold us all out, including 
you!” 
“Well . . . we all got away, didn’t we?” said Cho pleadingly. “You 
know, her mum works for the Ministry, it’s really difficult for her —” 
“Ron’s dad works for the Ministry too!” Harry said furiously. “And 
in case you hadn’t noticed, he hasn’t got ‘sneak’ written across his 
face —” 
“That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger’s,” said Cho 
fiercely. “She should have told us she’d jinxed that list —” 
“I think it was a brilliant idea,” said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and 
her eyes grew brighter. 
“Oh yes, I forgot — of course, if it was darling Hermione’s idea —” 
“Don’t start crying again,” said Harry warningly. 
“I wasn’t going to!” she shouted. 
“Yeah . . . well . . . good,” he said. “I’ve got enough to cope with at 
the moment.” 
“Go and cope with it then!” she said furiously, turning on her heel 
and stalking off. 
Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape’s dungeon, and 
though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 638  
Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he suc-
ceeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things he should 
have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door. 
“You’re late, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door be-
hind him. 
Snape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, cer-
tain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore’s Pen-
sieve. He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and 
turned to face Harry. 
“So,” he said. “Have you been practicing?” 
“Yes,” Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape’s 
desk. 
“Well, we’ll soon find out, won’t we?” said Snape smoothly. “Wand 
out, Potter.” 
Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk 
between them. His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and 
anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind. 
“On the count of three then,” said Snape lazily. “One — two —” 
Snape’s office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in. 
“Professor Snape, sir — oh — sorry —” 
Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise. 
“It’s all right, Draco,” said Snape, lowering his wand. “Potter is here 
for a little Remedial Potions.” 
Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had 
turned up to inspect Hagrid. 
“I didn’t know,” he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was 
burning. He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the 
truth at Malfoy — or, even better, to hit him with a good curse. 
“Well, Draco, what is it?” asked Snape. 
“It’s Professor Umbridge, sir — she needs your help,” said Malfoy. 
“They’ve found Montague, sir. He’s turned up jammed inside a toilet 
on the fourth floor.” 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 639  
“How did he get in there?” demanded Snape. 
“I don’t know, sir, he’s a bit confused. . . .” 
“Very well, very well — Potter,” said Snape, “we shall resume this 
lesson tomorrow evening instead.” 
He turned and swept from his office. Malfoy mouthed “Remedial  
Potions?” at Harry behind Snape’s back before following him. 
Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to 
leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to 
practice; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape, 
though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the 
whole school that he needed Remedial Potions. . . . 
He was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light 
dancing on the door frame. He stopped, looking at it, reminded of 
something. . . . Then he remembered: It was a little like the lights he 
had seen in his dream last night, the lights in the second room he had 
walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries. 
He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting 
on Snape’s desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling 
within. Snape’s thoughts . . . things he did not want Harry to see if he 
broke through Snape’s defenses accidentally. . . . 
Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him. . . . What 
was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry? 
The silvery lights shivered on the wall. . . . Harry took two steps to-
ward the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about 
the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from 
him? 
Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and 
faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague 
from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterward, 
or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . . 
Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape 
would want to make sure he was all right. . . . 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 640  
Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over 
it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his 
wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely 
silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end 
of his wand. 
The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned for-
ward over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once 
again, looking down into a room as though through a circular win-
dow in the ceiling. . . . In fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was 
looking down upon the Great Hall. . . . 
His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape’s thoughts. . . . 
His brain seemed to be in limbo. . . . It would be insane to do the 
thing that he was so strongly tempted to do. . . . He was trembling. 
. . . Snape could be back at any moment . . . but Harry thought of 
Cho’s anger, of Malfoy’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him. 
He took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface 
of Snape’s thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping 
Harry headfirst into the Pensieve. . . . 
He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he 
went, and then — 
He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four 
House tables were gone. Instead there were more than a hundred 
smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, 
head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was 
the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted 
their parchment. It was clearly exam time. 
Sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent 
heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. 
Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere. . . . 
This was his memory. . . . 
And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. 
Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY

kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping onto 
the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the 
parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and 
read the heading of the examination paper: 
defense against the dark arts — 
ordinary wizarding level 
So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry’s own age. His 
hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot 
more than his closest neighbors, and yet his writing was minuscule 
and cramped. 
“Five more minutes!” 
The voice made Harry jump; turning, he saw the top of Professor 
Flitwick’s head moving between the desks a short distance away. Pro-
fessor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very 
untidy black hair. . . . 
Harry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have 
knocked desks flying. Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across 
two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy’s head 
drew nearer and nearer. . . . He was straightening up now, putting 
down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment toward him so as to 
reread what he had written. . . . 
Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-
year-old father. 
Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: It was as though he 
was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James’s eyes were 
hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry’s, and there was no scar 
on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same 
eyebrows. James’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry’s did, his 
hands could have been Harry’s, and Harry could tell that when James 
stood up, they would be within an inch of each other’s heights. 
James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 642  
messier than it had been. Then, with a glance toward Professor 
Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats 
behind him. 
With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the 
thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back 
on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes 
with a sort of casual elegance neither James’s nor Harry’s could ever 
have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, 
though he didn’t seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this 
girl — Harry’s stomach gave another pleasurable squirm — was Re-
mus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon ap-
proaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: As he reread his answers 
he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly. 
So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere too . . . 
and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-
haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was 
chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground 
with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neigh-
bor’s paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at 
James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had 
drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they 
stand for? 
“Quills down, please!” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “That means 
you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parch-
ment! Accio!” 
More than a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and 
into Professor Flitwick’s outstretched arms, knocking him backward 
off his feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the front 
desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows, and 
lifted him onto his feet again. 
“Thank you . . . thank you,” panted Professor Flitwick. “Very well, 
everybody, you’re free to go!” 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 643  
Harry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the 
L. E. he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill 
and the exam question paper into his bag, which he slung over his 
back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him. 
Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, mov-
ing between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall, still 
absorbed in his own examination paper. Round-shouldered yet angu-
lar, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, his oily hair 
swinging about his face. 
A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James and Sirius, 
and by planting himself in the midst of this group, Harry managed to 
keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of 
James and his friends. 
“Did you like question ten, Moony?” asked Sirius as they emerged 
into the entrance hall. 
“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly. “ ‘Give five signs that identify the 
werewolf.’ Excellent question.” 
“D’you think you managed to get all the signs?” said James in tones 
of mock concern. 
“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd throng-
ing around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. 
“One: He’s sitting on my chair. Two: He’s wearing my clothes. Three: 
His name’s Remus Lupin . . .” 
Wormtail was the only one who didn’t laugh. 
“I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes, and the tufted tail,” 
he said anxiously, “but I couldn’t think what else —” 
“How thick are you, Wormtail?” said James impatiently. “You run 
round with a werewolf once a month —” 
“Keep your voice down,” implored Lupin. 
Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close 
by, still buried in his examination questions; but this was Snape’s 
memory, and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 644  
different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not 
be able to follow James any farther. To his intense relief, however, 
when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the 
lake, Snape followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with 
no fixed idea of where he was going. By jogging a little ahead of him, 
Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others. 
“Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,” he heard Sirius say. 
“I’ll be surprised if I don’t get Outstanding on it at least.” 
“Me too,” said James. He put his hand in his pocket and took out 
a struggling Golden Snitch. 
“Where’d you get that?” 
“Nicked it,” said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch, 
allowing it to fly as much as a foot away and seizing it again; his re-
flexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him in awe. 
They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge 
of the lake where Harry, Ron, and Hermione had spent a Sunday fin-
ishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass. 
Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, 
that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadows of a 
clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the O.W.L. paper as 
ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech 
and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. 
The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the 
bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great 
Hall were sitting with shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the 
water. 
Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around 
at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and 
bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the 
Snitch, letting it zoom farther and farther away, almost escaping but 
always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with 
his mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 645  
Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry 
wondered why James didn’t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but 
James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his father 
had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not 
get too tidy, and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the wa-
ter’s edge. 
“Put that away, will you?” said Sirius finally, as James made a fine 
catch and Wormtail let out a cheer. “Before Wormtail wets himself 
from excitement.” 
Wormtail turned slightly pink but James grinned. 
“If it bothers you,” he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket. 
Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for 
whom James would have stopped showing off. 
“I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.” 
“You might,” said Lupin darkly from behind his book. “We’ve still 
got Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me. . . . Here.” He 
held out his book. 
Sirius snorted. “I don’t need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.” 
“This’ll liven you up, Padfoot,” said James quietly. “Look who it 
is. . . .” 
Sirius’s head turned. He had become very still, like a dog that has 
scented a rabbit. 
“Excellent,” he said softly. “Snivellus.” 
Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at. 
Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L. paper in 
his bag. As he emerged from the shadows of the bushes and set off 
across the grass, Sirius and James stood up. Lupin and Wormtail re-
mained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his book, though his 
eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his 
eyebrows. Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with 
a look of avid anticipation on his face. 
“All right, Snivellus?” said James loudly. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 646  
Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an at-
tack: Dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes, and his 
wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, “Expelliarmus!” 
Snape’s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud 
in the grass behind him. Sirius let out a bark of laughter. 
“Impedimenta!” he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was 
knocked off his feet, halfway through a dive toward his own fallen 
wand. 
Students all around had turned to watch. Some of them had gotten 
to their feet and were edging nearer to watch. Some looked apprehen-
sive, others entertained. 
Snape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on 
him, wands up, James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the wa-
ter’s edge as he went. Wormtail was on his feet now, watching hun-
grily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view. 
“How’d the exam go, Snivelly?” said James. 
“I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,” said 
Sirius viciously. “There’ll be great grease marks all over it, they won’t 
be able to read a word.” 
Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular. 
Wormtail sniggered shrilly. Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx 
was still operating on him; he was struggling, as though bound by in-
visible ropes. 
“You — wait,” he panted, staring up at James with an expression of 
purest loathing. “You — wait. . . .” 
“Wait for what?” said Sirius coolly. “What’re you going to do, Sniv-
elly, wipe your nose on us?” 
Snape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but his 
wand being ten feet away nothing happened. 
“Wash out your mouth,” said James coldly. “Scourgify!” 
Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape’s mouth at once; the froth 
was covering his lips, making him gag, choking him — 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 647  
“Leave him ALONE!” 
James and Sirius looked around. James’s free hand jumped to his 
hair again. 
It was one of the girls from the lake edge. She had thick, dark red 
hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green almond-shaped 
eyes — Harry’s eyes. 
Harry’s mother . . . 
“All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was sud-
denly pleasant, deeper, more mature. 
“Leave him alone,” Lily repeated. She was looking at James with 
every sign of great dislike. “What’s he done to you?” 
“Well,” said James, appearing to deliberate the point, “it’s more the 
fact that he exists, if you know what I mean. . . .” 
Many of the surrounding watchers laughed, Sirius and Wormtail 
included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn’t, and 
neither did Lily. 
“You think you’re funny,” she said coldly. “But you’re just an arro-
gant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone.” 
“I will if you go out with me, Evans,” said James quickly. “Go on 
. . . Go out with me, and I’ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.” 
Behind him, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. Snape was be-
ginning to inch toward his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he 
crawled. 
“I wouldn’t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the 
giant squid,” said Lily. 
“Bad luck, Prongs,” said Sirius briskly, turning back to Snape. “OY!” 
But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there 
was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face, 
spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of 
light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling 
over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying 
underpants. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 648  
Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James, 
and Wormtail roared with laughter. 
Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as 
though she was going to smile, said, “Let him down!” 
“Certainly,” said James and he jerked his wand upward. Snape fell 
into a crumpled heap on the ground. Disentangling himself from his 
robes, he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, “Petrificus 
Totalus!” and Snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board. 
“LEAVE HIM ALONE!” Lily shouted. She had her own wand out 
now. James and Sirius eyed it warily. 
“Ah, Evans, don’t make me hex you,” said James earnestly. 
“Take the curse off him, then!” 
James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the 
countercurse. 
“There you go,” he said, as Snape struggled to his feet again, “you’re 
lucky Evans was here, Snivellus —” 
“I don’t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!” 
Lily blinked. “Fine,” she said coolly. “I won’t bother in future. And 
I’d wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.” 
“Apologize to Evans!” James roared at Snape, his wand pointed 
threateningly at him. 
“I don’t want you to make him apologize,” Lily shouted, rounding 
on James. “You’re as bad as he is. . . .” 
“What?” yelped James. “I’d NEVER call you a — you-know-what!” 
“Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like 
you’ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid 
Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you 
just because you can — I’m surprised your broomstick can get off the 
ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.” 
She turned on her heel and hurried away. 
“Evans!” James shouted after her, “Hey, EVANS!” 
But she didn’t look back. 
SNAPE’S  WORST 
MEMORY 
 649  
“What is it with her?” said James, trying and failing to look as 
though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him. 
“Reading between the lines, I’d say she thinks you’re a bit conceited, 
mate,” said Sirius. 
“Right,” said James, who looked furious now, “right —” 
There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hang-
ing upside down in the air. 
“Who wants to see me take off Snivelly’s pants?” 
But whether James really did take off Snape’s pants, Harry never 
found out. A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a 
pincerlike grip. Wincing, Harry looked around to see who had hold of 
him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape 
standing right beside him, white with rage. 
“Having fun?” 
Harry felt himself rising into the air. The summer’s day evaporated 
around him, he was floating upward through icy blackness, Snape’s 
hand still tight upon his upper arm. Then, with a swooping feeling as 
though he had turned head over heels in midair, his feet hit the stone 
floor of Snape’s dungeon, and he was standing again beside the Pen-
sieve on Snape’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s 
study. 
“So,” said Snape, gripping Harry’s arm so tightly Harry’s hand was 
starting to feel numb. “So . . . been enjoying yourself, Potter?” 
“N-no . . .” said Harry, trying to free his arm. 
It was scary: Snape’s lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth 
were bared. 
“Amusing man, your father, wasn’t he?” said Snape, shaking Harry 
so hard that his glasses slipped down his nose. 
“I — didn’t —” 
Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard 
onto the dungeon floor. 
“You will not tell anybody what you saw!” Snape bellowed. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT 
 650  
“No,” said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could. 
“No, of course I w —” 
“Get out, get out, I don’t want to see you in this office ever again!” 
And as Harry hurtled toward the door, a jar of dead cockroaches 
exploded over his head. He wrenched the door open and flew away up 
the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors between 
himself and Snape. There he leaned against the wall, panting, and 
rubbing his bruised arm. 
He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor 
to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen. What was making 
Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or hav-
ing jars thrown at him — it was that he knew how it felt to be humil-
iated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape 
had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he 
had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had al-
ways told him.

ut why haven’t you got Occlumency lessons anymore?” said Her-
mione, frowning. 
“I’ve told you,” Harry muttered. “Snape reckons I can carry on by 
myself now I’ve got the basics. . . .” 
“So you’ve stopped having funny dreams?” said Hermione skepti-
cally. 
“Pretty much,” said Harry, not looking at her. 
“Well, I don’t think Snape should stop until you’re absolutely sure 
you can control them!” said Hermione indignantly. “Harry, I think 
you should go back to him and ask —” 
“No,” said Harry forcefully. “Just drop it, Hermione, okay?” 
It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her 
custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules 
for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it — it was easier 
than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful. 
Ron had been startled to discover that there were only six weeks left 
until their exams. 
 
B 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 652  
“How can that come as a shock?” Hermione demanded, as she 
tapped each little square on Ron’s schedule with her wand so that it 
flashed a different color according to its subject. 
“I dunno . . .” said Ron, “there’s been a lot going on. . . .” 
“Well, there you are,” she said, handing him his schedule, “if you 
follow that you should do fine.” 
Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened. 
“You’ve given me an evening off every week!” 
“That’s for Quidditch practice,” said Hermione. 
The smile faded from Ron’s face. 
“What’s the point?” he said. “We’ve got about as much chance of 
winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad’s got of becoming Min-
ister of Magic. . . .” 
Hermione said nothing. She was looking at Harry, who was staring 
blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks 
pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched. 
“What’s wrong, Harry?” 
“What?” he said quickly. “Nothing . . .” 
He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be 
looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad 
job and slunk away under Hermione’s chair. 
“I saw Cho earlier,” said Hermione tentatively, “and she looked re-
ally miserable too. . . . Have you two had a row again?” 
“Wha — oh yeah, we have,” said Harry, seizing gratefully on the 
excuse. 
“What about?” 
“That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,” said Harry. 
“Yeah, well, I don’t blame you!” said Ron angrily, setting down his 
study schedule. “If it hadn’t been for her . . .” 
Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry 
found helpful. All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say “yeah” 
 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 653  
 and “that’s right” whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to 
dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve. 
He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. 
He had been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that 
he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snape’s aspersions 
on his father’s character. Hadn’t people like Hagrid and Sirius told  
Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what 
Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry’s head. . . . 
He was as bad, wasn’t he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor 
McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemak-
ers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the 
Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dan-
gling someone upside down for the fun of it . . . not unless they re-
ally loathed them . . . Perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really 
deserved it . . . 
Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had 
suffered at James’s hands — but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to 
you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you 
know what I mean?” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius 
said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grim-
mauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that 
he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius. . . . 
But in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen. . . . 
Harry reminded himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had 
been decent, yet the memory of the look on her face as she had 
shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else. She 
had clearly loathed James and Harry simply could not understand 
how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even won-
dered whether James had forced her into it. . . . 
For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of 
comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 654  
James he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold 
and miserable at the thought of him. 
The weather grew breezier, brighter, and warmer as the holidays 
passed, but Harry was stuck with the rest of the fifth and seventh 
years, who were all trapped inside, traipsing back and forth to the li-
brary. Harry pretended that his bad mood had no other cause but the 
approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of study-
ing themselves, his excuse went unchallenged. 
“Harry, I’m talking to you, can you hear me?” 
“Huh?” 
He looked around. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had 
joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was 
late on Sunday evening; Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor 
Tower to review Ancient Runes; Ron had Quidditch practice. 
“Oh hi,” said Harry, pulling his books back toward him. “How 
come you’re not at practice?” 
“It’s over,” said Ginny. “Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hos-
pital wing.” 
“Why?” 
“Well, we’re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his 
own bat.” She sighed heavily. “Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it’s 
only just got through Umbridge’s new screening process. . . .” 
She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had 
clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a 
scribbled note across it in red ink, reading inspected and passed by 
the hogwarts high inquisitor. 
“It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said Ginny. “There’s one for you. . . . 
There you go. . . .” 
She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, 
iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of 
Fizzing Whizbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his hor-
ror, felt a hard lump rise in his throat. 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 655  
“Are you okay, Harry?” asked Ginny quietly. 
“Yeah, I’m fine,” said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was 
painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made 
him feel like this. 
“You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted. “You know, I’m 
sure if you just talked to Cho . . .” 
“It’s not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely. 
“Who is it, then?” asked Ginny. 
“I . . .” 
He glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening; 
Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books 
for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott. 
“I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he muttered. “But I know I can’t.” 
More to give himself something to do than because he really 
wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit, 
and put it into his mouth. 
“Well,” said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg too, “if 
you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to 
do it. . . .” 
“Come on,” said Harry hopelessly. “With Umbridge policing the 
fires and reading all our mail?” 
“The thing about growing up with Fred and George,” said Ginny 
thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if 
you’ve got enough nerve.” 
Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate — 
Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with demen-
tors — or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had 
been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful. . . . 
“WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?” 
“Oh damn,” whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. “I forgot —” 
Madam Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face 
contorted with rage. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE

“Chocolate in the library!” she screamed. “Out — out — OUT!” 
And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry’s books, bag, and 
ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them 
repeatedly over the head as they ran. 
 
As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examina-
tions, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets, and notices concerning various 
Wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly 
before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the 
board, which read: 
 
CAREER ADVICE 
All fifth years will be required to attend a short meeting 
with their Head of House during the first week of the Sum-
mer term, in which they will be given the opportunity to 
discuss their future careers. Times of individual appoint-
ments are listed below. 
 
Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Pro-
fessor McGonagall’s office at half-past two on Monday, which would 
mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent 
a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all 
the career information that had been left there for their perusal. 
“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the 
holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-
and-wand emblem of St. Mungo’s on its front. “It says here you need 
at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, 
Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey. . . . 
Don’t want much, do they?” 
“Well, it’s a very responsible job, isn’t it?” said Hermione absently. 
She was poring over a bright pink-and-orange leaflet that was headed 
so you think you’d like to work in muggle relations? “You don’t

seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles. . . . All they 
want is an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies. . . . ‘Much more important is your 
enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense of fun!’ ” 
“You’d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” 
said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like . . .” He 
was halfway through a pamphlet on Wizard banking. “Listen to this: 
“ ‘Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure, and 
substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position 
with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-
Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad. . . .’ They want Arithmancy, 
though. . . . You could do it, Hermione!” 
“I don’t much fancy banking,” said Hermione vaguely, now im-
mersed in have you got what it takes to train security trolls? 
“Hey,” said a voice in Harry’s ear. He looked around; Fred and 
George had come to join them. “Ginny’s had a word with us about 
you,” said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them 
and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to 
slide off onto the floor. “She says you need to talk to Sirius?” 
“What?” said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway 
toward picking up make a bang at the department of magical 
accidents and catastrophes. 
“Yeah . . .” said Harry, trying to sound casual, “yeah, I thought I’d 
like —” 
“Don’t be so ridiculous,” said Hermione, straightening up and 
looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. “With Um-
bridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?” 
“Well, we think we can find a way around that,” said George, 
stretching and smiling. “It’s a simple matter of causing a diversion. 
Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the 
mayhem front during the Easter holidays?” 
“What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure 
time?” continued Fred. “No point at all, we answered ourselves. And 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 658  
of course, we’d have messed up people’s studying too, which would be 
the very last thing we’d want to do.” 
He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather 
taken aback by this thoughtfulness. 
“But it’s business as usual from tomorrow,” Fred continued briskly. 
“And if we’re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that 
Harry can have his chat with Sirius?” 
“Yes, but still,” said Hermione with an air of explaining something 
very simple to somebody very obtuse, “even if you do cause a diver-
sion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?” 
“Umbridge’s office,” said Harry quietly. 
He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no 
alternative; Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was 
not being watched was her own. 
“Are — you — insane?” said Hermione in a hushed voice. 
Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade 
and was watching the conversation warily. 
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging. 
“And how are you going to get in there in the first place?” 
Harry was ready for this question. 
“Sirius’s knife,” he said. 
“Excuse me?” 
“Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that’ll open any lock,” 
said Harry. “So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t 
work, which I bet she has —” 
“What do you think about this?” Hermione demanded of Ron, and 
Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her hus-
band during Harry’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place. 
“I dunno,” said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an 
opinion. “If Harry wants to do it, it’s up to him, isn’t it?” 
“Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred, clapping Ron 
hard on the back. “Right, then. We’re thinking of doing it tomorrow, 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 659  
just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact if every-
body’s in the corridors — Harry, we’ll set it off in the east wing some-
where, draw her right away from her own office — I reckon we 
should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?” he said, 
looking at George. 
“Easy,” said George. 
“What sort of diversion is it?” asked Ron. 
“You’ll see, little bro,” said Fred, as he and George got up again. 
“At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor 
round about five o’clock tomorrow.” 
 
Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he 
had done on the morning of his hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It 
was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge’s office and us-
ing her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, 
though that was certainly bad enough — today also happened to be 
the first time he would be in close proximity with Snape since Snape 
had thrown him out of his office, as they had Potions that day. 
After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry 
got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville’s 
bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, 
misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the 
towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented 
Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that 
would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was des-
perate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know of 
any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his 
father’s behavior. . . . 
Something caught Harry’s attention: movement on the edge of the 
Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid 
emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry 
watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 660  
inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not 
emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could 
not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. . . . 
Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk, and 
started to dress. 
With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge’s office ahead, 
Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not 
reckoned on Hermione’s almost continual attempts to dissuade him 
from what he was planning to do at five o’clock. For the first time ever, 
she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic 
as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admoni-
tions that Harry tried very hard to ignore. 
“. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she’ll 
be able to guess you’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect 
she’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions. . . .” 
“Hermione,” said Ron in a low and indignant voice, “are you going 
to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to 
take notes instead?” 
“You take notes for a change, it won’t kill you!” 
By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was 
speaking to Hermione any longer. Undeterred, she took advantage of 
their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all 
uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to 
waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks. 
Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry 
were invisible. Harry was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was 
one of Uncle Vernon’s favorites, and on the whole was grateful he had 
to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to 
endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found 
the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to 
find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration 
Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 661  
potion into a flask, corked it, and took it up to Snape’s desk for mark-
ing, feeling that he might at last have scraped an E. 
He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; Malfoy 
gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. His po-
tion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him 
with a look of gloating pleasure. 
“Whoops,” he said softly. “Another zero, then, Potter . . .” 
Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, 
intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to 
his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished. 
“I’m sorry!” said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. “I’m 
really sorry, Harry, I thought you’d finished, so I cleared up!” 
Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang he 
hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure 
that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so 
that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge’s 
office again. 
He was in such a bad mood by the time that he got to Divination 
that he had quite forgotten his career appointment with Professor 
McGonagall, remembering only when Ron asked him why he wasn’t 
in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only 
a few minutes late. 
“Sorry, Professor,” he panted, as he closed the door. “I forgot. . . .” 
“No matter, Potter,” she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody 
else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked around. 
Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a 
fussy little pie-frill around her neck, and a small, horribly smug smile 
on her face. 
“Sit down, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands 
shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk. 
Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pre-
tend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard. 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 662  
“Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might 
have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into 
sixth and seventh years,” said Professor McGonagall. “Have you had 
any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave 
Hogwarts?” 
“Er,” said Harry. 
He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very dis-
tracting. 
“Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry. 
“Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled. 
“You’d need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall, ex-
tracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and 
opening it. “They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing 
under ‘Exceeds Expectations’ grade, I see. Then you would be re-
quired to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at 
the Auror office. It’s a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the 
best. In fact, I don’t think anybody has been taken on in the last three 
years.” 
At this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as 
though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor 
McGonagall ignored her. 
“You’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?” 
she went on, talking a little more loudly than before. 
“Yes,” said Harry. “Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?” 
“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “I would also 
advise —” 
Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this 
time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened 
them again, and continued as though nothing had happened. 
“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently 
need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell 
you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 663  
classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at 
Ordinary Wizarding Level. I’d say you’re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the 
moment, so you’ll need to put in some good hard work before the ex-
ams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, 
always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,” she added, with the 
merest flicker of a smile. “Poisons and antidotes are essential study for 
Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to 
take students who get anything other than ‘Outstanding’ in their 
O.W.L.s, so —” 
Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet. 
“May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?” Professor McGonagall 
asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge. 
“Oh no, thank you very much,” said Umbridge, with that simper-
ing laugh Harry hated so much. “I just wondered whether I could 
make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?” 
“I daresay you’ll find you can,” said Professor McGonagall through 
tightly gritted teeth. 
“I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the tempera-
ment for an Auror?” said Professor Umbridge sweetly. 
“Were you?” said Professor McGonagall haughtily. “Well, Potter,” 
she continued, as though there had been no interruption, “if you are 
serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on 
bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Profes-
sor Flitwick has graded you between Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expec-
tations’ for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory; 
as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally 
high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure 
you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores?” 
“Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,” simpered Professor Um-
bridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. “I was just concerned 
that you might not have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the 
Dark Arts marks in front of you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 664  
“What, this thing?” said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revul-
sion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves 
of Harry’s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, 
then placed it back into the folder without comment. 
“Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a 
pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror —” 
“Did you not understand my note, Minerva?” asked Professor Um-
bridge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough. 
“Of course I understood it,” said Professor McGonagall, her teeth 
clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled. 
“Well, then, I am confused. . . . I’m afraid I don’t quite understand 
how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that —” 
“False hope?” repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look 
round at Professor Umbridge. “He has achieved high marks in all his 
Defense Against the Dark Arts tests —” 
“I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you 
will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in 
his classes with me —” 
“I should have made my meaning plainer,” said Professor McGo-
nagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. “He has 
achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by 
a competent teacher.” 
Professor Umbridge’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb 
blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard, 
and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from 
side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin 
nostrils flared, her eyes burning. 
“Any questions, Potter?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. “What sort of character and aptitude tests do the 
Ministry do on you, if you get enough N.E.W.T.s?” 
“Well, you’ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pres- 
 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 665  
sure and so forth,” said Professor McGonagall, “perseverance and ded-
ication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to men-
tion very high skills in practical defense. It will mean a lot more study 
even after you’ve left school, so unless you’re prepared to —” 
“I think you’ll also find,” said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 
“that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Au-
rora. Their criminal records.” 
“— unless you’re prepared to take even more exams after Hog-
warts, you should really look at another —” 
“— which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an 
Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.” 
“A very good chance, then,” said Professor McGonagall. 
“Potter has a criminal record,” said Umbridge loudly. 
“Potter has been cleared of all charges,” said Professor McGonagall, 
even more loudly. 
Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not 
make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanor 
had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look 
oddly sinister. 
“Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!” 
Professor McGonagall got to her feet too, and in her case this was a 
much more impressive move. She towered over Professor Umbridge. 
“Potter,” she said in ringing tones, “I will assist you to become an 
Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I will 
make sure you achieve the required results!” 
“The Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter!” said Um-
bridge, her voice rising furiously. 
“There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is 
ready to join!” shouted Professor McGonagall. 
“Aha!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at 
McGonagall. “Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That’s what you want, isn’t  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 666  
it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Al-
bus Dumbledore! You think you’ll be where I am, don’t you, Senior 
Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!” 
“You are raving,” said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. 
“Potter, that concludes our career consultation.” 
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the 
room, not daring to look at Umbridge. He could hear her and Profes-
sor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back 
along the corridor. 
Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run 
a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson 
that afternoon. 
“I hope you’ve thought better of what you were planning to do, 
Harry,” Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their 
books to chapter thirty-four (“Non-Retaliation and Negotiation”). 
“Umbridge looks like she’s in a really bad mood already. . . .” 
Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who 
kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes un-
focused, thinking. . . . 
He could just imagine Professor McGonagall’s reaction if he were 
caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge’s office mere hours after she 
had vouched for him. . . . There was nothing to stop him simply go-
ing back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the 
next summer holiday he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the 
scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve. . . . Nothing, except that 
the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as 
though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach. . . . And then 
there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already 
planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was 
currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father’s old Invisi-
bility Cloak. . . . 
 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 667  
But the fact remained that if he were caught . . . 
“Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!” 
whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Um-
bridge. “And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for 
nothing!” 
He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the mem-
ory of what his father had done on a summer’s day more than twenty 
years ago. . . . 
And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffin-
dor common room. . . .”You’re less like your father than I thought. 
. . . The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James. . . .” 
But did he want to be like his father anymore? 
“Harry, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” Hermione said in anguished 
tones as the bell rang at the end of the class. 
He did not answer; he did not know what to do. Ron seemed de-
termined to give neither his opinion nor his advice. He would not 
look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dis-
suading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, “Give it a rest, okay? 
He can make up his own mind.” 
Harry’s heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway 
along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of 
a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells 
reverberating from somewhere above them. People exiting the class-
rooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up 
at the ceiling fearfully — 
Then Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her 
short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the 
opposite direction: It was now or never. 
“Harry — please!” said Hermione weakly. 
But he had made up his mind — hitching his bag more securely 
onto his shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 668  
now hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was 
about in the east wing. . . . 
Harry reached the corridor where Umbridge’s office was situated 
and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose 
helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized 
Sirius’s knife, and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly 
and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the 
corridor until he reached Umbridge’s door. 
He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it 
and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny 
click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed 
the door quickly behind him, and looked around. 
It was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on 
the plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated 
broomsticks. 
Harry pulled off his cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found 
what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glit-
tering Floo powder. 
He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. 
He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it 
must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch 
of powder and dropped it onto the logs stacked neatly beneath him. 
They exploded at once into emerald-green flames. 
“Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” Harry said loudly and clearly. 
It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced; 
he had traveled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been 
his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through 
the network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country: 
This time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge’s 
office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire. . . . 
And then, abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling  
 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 669  
rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler 
around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up 
out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat 
poring over a piece of parchment. 
“Sirius?” 
The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin. 
“Harry!” he said, looking thoroughly shocked. “What are you — 
what’s happened, is everything all right?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I just wondered — I mean, I just fancied a — 
a chat with Sirius.” 
“I’ll call him,” said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed. 
“He went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the at-
tic again. . . .” 
And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left 
with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why 
Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak 
out of the fire — his knees were already objecting painfully to their 
prolonged contact with Umbridge’s hard stone floor. 
Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later. 
“What is it?” said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out 
of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he 
and Harry were on a level; Lupin knelt down too, looking very con-
cerned. “Are you all right? Do you need help?” 
“No,” said Harry, “it’s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk 
. . . about my dad. . . .” 
They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have 
time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer 
by the second, and he guessed that five minutes had already passed 
from the start of the diversion — George had only guaranteed him 
twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he 
had seen in the Pensieve. 
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 670  
When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a mo-
ment. Then Lupin said quietly, “I wouldn’t like you to judge your 
father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen —” 
“I’m fifteen!” said Harry heatedly. 
“Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and Snape hated each 
other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of 
those things, you can understand that, can’t you? I think James was 
everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at 
Quidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this 
little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James — 
whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry — always hated 
the Dark Arts.” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, 
just because — well, just because you said you were bored,” he fin-
ished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice. 
“I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly. 
Lupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, “Look, Harry, what 
you’ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in 
the school at whatever they did — everyone thought they were the 
height of cool — if they sometimes got a bit carried away —” 
“If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said Sirius. 
Lupin smiled. 
“He kept messing up his hair,” said Harry in a pained voice. 
Sirius and Lupin laughed. 
“I’d forgotten he used to do that,” said Sirius affectionately. 
“Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly. 
“Yeah,” said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and 
Lupin beamed reminiscently. “Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an 
idiot.” 
“Of course he was a bit of an idiot!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were 
all idiots! Well — not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at 
Lupin, but Lupin shook his head.

“Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the 
guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?” 
“Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves 
sometimes. . . . That was something. . . .” 
“And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was 
on his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the 
lake, hoping they were watching him!” 
“Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was 
around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He couldn’t stop himself showing off 
whenever he got near her.” 
“How come she married him?” Harry asked miserably. “She hated 
him!” 
“Nah, she didn’t,” said Sirius. 
“She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin. 
“Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius. 
“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin. 
“Even Snape?” said Harry. 
“Well,” said Lupin slowly, “Snape was a special case. I mean, he 
never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn’t really expect 
James to take that lying down, could you?” 
“And my mum was okay with that?” 
“She didn’t know too much about it, to tell you the truth,” said Sir-
ius. “I mean, James didn’t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him 
in front of her, did he?” 
Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced. 
“Look,” he said, “your father was the best friend I ever had, and he 
was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He 
grew out of it.” 
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry heavily. “I just never thought I’d feel sorry 
for Snape.” 
“Now you mention it,” said Lupin, a faint crease between his eye-
brows, “how did Snape react when he found you’d seen all this?” 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE

“He told me he’d never teach me Occlumency again,” said Harry 
indifferently, “like that’s a big disappoint —” 
“He WHAT?” shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a 
mouthful of ashes. 
“Are you serious, Harry?” said Lupin quickly. “He’s stopped giving 
you lessons?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great overreac-
tion. “But it’s okay, I don’t care, it’s a bit of a relief to tell you the —” 
“I’m coming up there to have a word with Snape!” said Sirius force-
fully and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back 
down again. 
“If anyone’s going to tell Snape it will be me!” he said firmly. “But 
Harry, first of all, you’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no ac-
count is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears —” 
“I can’t tell him that, he’d kill me!” said Harry, outraged. “You 
didn’t see him when we got out of the Pensieve —” 
“Harry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlu-
mency!” said Lupin sternly. “Do you understand me? Nothing!” 
“Okay, okay,” said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention 
annoyed. “I’ll . . . I’ll try and say something to him. . . . But it won’t 
be . . .” 
He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps. 
“Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?” 
“No,” said Sirius, glancing behind him. “It must be somebody your 
end . . .” 
Harry’s heart skipped several beats. 
“I’d better go!” he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out 
of Grimmauld Place’s fire. For a moment his head seemed to be re-
volving on his shoulders, and then he found himself kneeling in front 
of Umbridge’s fire with his head firmly back on, watching the emerald 
flames flicker and die.

“Quickly, quickly!” he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside 
the office door. “Ah, she’s left it open. . . .” 
Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull 
it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked ab-
solutely delighted about something and was talking to himself fever-
ishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge’s 
desk, and began rifling through the papers inside it. 
“Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it 
at last. . . . They’ve had it coming to them for years. . . .” 
He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly 
back out of the door, clutching it to his chest. 
Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure that he had his bag and the 
Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open 
the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling 
along faster than Harry had ever seen him go. 
One landing down from Umbridge’s office and Harry thought it 
was safe to become visible again; he pulled off the cloak, shoved it in 
his bag and hurried onward. There was a great deal of shouting and 
movement coming from the entrance hall. He ran down the marble 
staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled 
there. 
It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Stu-
dents were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, 
Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); 
teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the on-
lookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all look-
ing exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was 
bobbing overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in 
the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who 
had just been cornered. 
“So!” said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was  
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE 
 674  
standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down 
upon her prey. “So . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor 
into a swamp, do you?” 
“Pretty amusing, yeah,” said Fred, looking back up at her without 
the slightest sign of fear. 
Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with 
happiness. 
“I’ve got the form, Headmistress,” he said hoarsely, waving the 
piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. “I’ve 
got the form and I’ve got the whips waiting. . . . Oh, let me do it 
now. . . .” 
“Very good, Argus,” she said. “You two,” she went on, gazing down 
at Fred and George, “are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers 
in my school.” 
“You know what?” said Fred. “I don’t think we are.” 
He turned to his twin. 
“George,” said Fred, “I think we’ve outgrown full-time education.” 
“Yeah, I’ve been feeling that way myself,” said George lightly. 
“Time to test our talents in the real world, d’you reckon?” asked 
Fred. 
“Definitely,” said George. 
And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands 
and said together, “Accio Brooms!” 
Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to 
his left he ducked just in time — Fred and George’s broomsticks, 
one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge 
had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor to-
ward their owners. They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and 
stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on 
the flagged stone floor. 
“We won’t be seeing you,” Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging 
his leg over his broomstick. 
CAREER  ADVICE 
 675  
“Yeah, don’t bother to keep in touch,” said George, mounting his 
own. 
Fred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent, 
watchful crowd. 
“If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated up-
stairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley — Weasleys’ Wiz-
arding Wheezes,” he said in a loud voice. “Our new premises!” 
“Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they’re going to 
use our products to get rid of this old bat,” added George, pointing at 
Professor Umbridge. 
“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the In-
quisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, 
shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously 
below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his 
level above the crowd. 
“Give her hell from us, Peeves.” 
And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a stu-
dent before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute 
as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the 
students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious 
sunset.

he story of Fred and George’s flight to freedom was retold so of-
ten over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon 
become the stuff of Hogwarts legend. Within a week, even those who 
had been eyewitnesses were half-convinced that they had seen the 
twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms, pelting her with Dung-
bombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath 
of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them, 
so that Harry frequently heard students saying things like, “Honestly, 
some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this 
place,” or else, “One more lesson like that and I might just do a 
Weasley. . . .” 
Fred and George had made sure that nobody was likely to forget 
them very soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how 
to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of 
the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different 
means of removing it but without success. Eventually the area was 
roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of 
punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that 
T 
GRAWP 
 677  
teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp 
in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire 
Whiz-Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle. 
Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge’s 
office door, through which Fred and George’s Cleansweeps had 
smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed 
Harry’s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, Umbridge 
had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were 
far from over. 
Inspired by Fred and George’s example, a great number of students 
were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-
Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-
snouted niffler into Umbridge’s office, which promptly tore the place 
apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge on her reen-
trance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs 
and Stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it be-
came the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms 
on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of 
fresh clean air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of 
wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads. 
Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, 
desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were 
now so many of them that he did not know which way to turn. The 
Inquisitorial Squad were attempting to help him, but odd things kept 
happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch 
team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that 
made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes. Pansy 
Parkinson, to Hermione’s delight, missed all her lessons the following 
day, as she had sprouted antlers. 
Meanwhile it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred 
and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge 
only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 678  
faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both 
nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the 
mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stub-
bornly they were suffering “Umbridge-itis.” After putting four succes-
sive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was 
forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating, and 
vomiting students to leave her classes in droves. 
But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that 
master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred’s parting 
words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school, 
upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, and toppling statues 
and vases. Twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which 
she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. He smashed 
lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the 
heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment 
to topple into fires or out of windows, flooded the second floor when 
he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantu-
las in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he 
fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge 
and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke. 
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help 
her. Indeed, a week after Fred and George’s departure Harry witnessed 
Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was deter-
minedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard 
her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews 
the other way.” 
To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn 
in the toilet. He remained confused and disorientated and his parents 
were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, 
looking extremely angry. 
“Should we say something?” said Hermione in a worried voice, 
pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see 
GRAWP 
 679  
Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. “About what happened to 
him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?” 
“ ’Course not, he’ll recover,” said Ron indifferently. 
“Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it?” said Harry in a sat-
isfied voice. 
He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be 
charming with their wands. Harry’s spouted four very short legs that 
would not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron’s 
grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with 
great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the 
cup to crack into two. 
“Reparo!” said Hermione quickly, mending Ron’s cup with a wave 
of her wand. “That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s perma-
nently injured?” 
“Who cares?” said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood drunkenly 
again, trembling violently at the knees. “Montague shouldn’t have 
tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want 
to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!” 
“You?” she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away 
across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs and replac-
ing it in front of her. “Why should I be worried about you?” 
“When Mum’s next letter finally gets through Umbridge’s screen-
ing process,” said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail 
legs tried feebly to support its weight, “I’m going to be in deep trou-
ble. I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s sent a Howler again.” 
“But —” 
“It’ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,” said Ron darkly. 
“She’ll say I should’ve stopped them leaving, I should’ve grabbed the 
ends of their brooms and hung on or something. . . . Yeah, it’ll be all 
my fault. . . .” 
“Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done 
anything! But I’m sure she won’t, I mean, if it’s really true they’ve got 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 680  
premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for 
ages. . . .” 
“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said 
Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed 
again and it lay twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll 
need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, 
she’ll want to know what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that 
sort of gold. . . .” 
“Well, yes, that occurred to me too,” said Hermione, allowing her 
teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry’s, whose stubby little 
legs were still unable to touch the desktop. “I’ve been wondering 
whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or 
something awful. . . .” 
“He hasn’t,” said Harry curtly. 
“How do you know?” said Ron and Hermione together. 
“Because —” Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally 
seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping 
silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were crimi-
nals. “Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard 
winnings last June.” 
There was a shocked silence, then Hermione’s teacup jogged right 
over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor. 
“Oh, Harry, you didn’t!” she said. 
“Yes, I did,” said Harry mutinously. “And I don’t regret it either — 
I didn’t need the gold, and they’ll be great at a joke shop. . . .” 
“But this is excellent!” said Ron, looking thrilled. “It’s all your fault, 
Harry — Mum can’t blame me at all! Can I tell her?” 
“Yeah, I suppose you’d better,” said Harry dully. “ ’Specially if she 
thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something. . . .” 
Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry 
had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack be-

 681  
fore long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and 
were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with 
a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air. 
Harry interrupted her before she had even started. 
“It’s no good nagging me, it’s done,” he said firmly. “Fred and 
George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds 
of it — and I can’t get it back from them and I don’t want to. So save 
your breath, Hermione.” 
“I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George!” she said in 
an injured voice. 
Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty 
look. 
“No, I wasn’t!” she said angrily. “As a matter of fact, I was going to 
ask Harry when he’s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlu-
mency lessons again!” 
Harry’s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred 
and George’s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many 
hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As 
Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to 
Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell 
them. He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted 
Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this 
ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept revert-
ing to it when Harry least expected it. 
“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” Hermione 
said now, “because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your 
sleep again. . . .” 
Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look 
ashamed of himself. 
“You were only muttering a bit,” he mumbled apologetically. 
“Something about ‘just a bit farther.’ ” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 682  
“I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,” Harry lied 
brutally. “I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the 
Quaffle.” 
Ron’s ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: He had 
not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort. 
Last night he had once again made the journey along the Depart-
ment of Mysteries corridor. He had passed through the circular room, 
then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found him-
self again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were 
ranged dusty glass spheres. . . . 
He had hurried straight toward row number ninety-seven, turned 
left, and ran along it. . . . It had probably been then that he had spo-
ken aloud. . . . Just a bit farther . . . for he could feel his conscious self  
struggling to wake . . . and before he had reached the end of the row, 
he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of 
his four-poster. 
“You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you?” said Hermione, look-
ing beadily at Harry. “You are keeping going with your Occlumency?” 
“Of course I am,” said Harry, trying to sound as though this ques-
tion was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was that 
he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full 
of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue. 
The problem was that with just under a month to go until the ex-
ams and every free moment devoted to studying, his mind seemed 
saturated with information when he went to bed so that he found it 
very difficult to get to sleep at all. When he did, his overwrought brain 
presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He 
also suspected that part of his mind — the part that often spoke in 
Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down 
that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before 
he could reach journey’s end. 
“You know,” said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Mon-
GRAWP 
 683  
tague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in 
with a chance of winning the Cup.” 
“Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry, glad of a change of subject. 
“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff 
next Saturday —” 
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, losing track of what he was agree-
ing to: Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, deter-
minedly not looking at him. 
 
The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Raven-
claw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although 
Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last 
match, Gryffindor was not daring to hope for victory, due mainly 
(though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron’s abysmal goalkeep-
ing record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism. 
“I mean, I can’t get any worse, can I?” he told Harry and Hermione 
grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. “Nothing to lose 
now, is there?” 
“You know,” said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the 
pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, “I think Ron 
might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly 
gave him a lot of confidence. . . .” 
Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live ea-
gle perched on top of her head. 
“Oh gosh, I forgot!” said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its 
wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing 
Slytherins. “Cho will be playing, won’t she?” 
Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted. 
They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, 
clear day. Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself 
hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for 
more rousing choruses of “Weasley Is Our King.” 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 684  
Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George 
had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out onto 
the pitches he named the players with something less than his usual 
gusto. 
“. . . Bradley . . . Davies . . . Chang,” he said, and Harry felt his 
stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho 
walked out onto the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight 
breeze. He was not sure what he wanted to happen anymore, except 
that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting 
animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms 
caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy. 
“And they’re off!” said Lee. “And Davies takes the Quaffle immedi-
ately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges John-
son, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well. . . . He’s going straight 
for goal! He’s going to shoot — and — and —” Lee swore very 
loudly. “And he’s scored.” 
Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Pre-
dictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began 
to sing: 
 
Weasley cannot save a thing, 
He cannot block a single ring . . . 
 
“Harry,” said a hoarse voice in Harry’s ear. “Hermione . . .” 
Harry looked around and saw Hagrid’s enormous bearded face 
sticking between the seats; apparently he had squeezed his way all 
along the row behind, for the first and second years he had just passed 
had a ruffled, flattened look about them. For some reason, Hagrid was 
bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though he was still at 
least four feet taller than everybody else. 
“Listen,” he whispered, “can yeh come with me? Now? While ev’ry-
one’s watchin’ the match?” 
GRAWP 
 685  
“Er . . . can’t it wait, Hagrid?” asked Harry. “Till the match is 
over? 
“No,” said Hagrid. “No, Harry, it’s gotta be now . . . while ev’ry-
one’s lookin’ the other way. . . . Please?” 
Hagrid’s nose was gently dripping blood. His eyes were both black-
ened. Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the 
school; he looked utterly woebegone. 
“ ’Course,” said Harry at once, “’course we’ll come. . . .” 
He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing 
much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them. 
The people in Hagrid’s row were not complaining, merely attempting 
to make themselves as small as possible. 
“I ’ppreciate this, you two, I really do,” said Hagrid as they reached 
the stairs. He kept looking around nervously as they descended to-
ward the lawn below. “I jus’ hope she doesn’ notice us goin’. . . .” 
“You mean Umbridge?” said Harry. “She won’t, she’s got her whole 
Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn’t you see? She must be ex-
pecting trouble at the match.” 
“Yeah, well, a bit o’ trouble wouldn’ hurt,” said Hagrid, pausing to 
peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn be-
tween there and his cabin was deserted. “Give us more time . . .” 
“What is it, Hagrid?” said Hermione, looking up at him with a 
concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the lawn to-
ward the edge of the forest. 
“Yeh — yeh’ll see in a mo’,” said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder 
as a great roar rose from the stands behind them. “Hey — did some-
one jus’ score?” 
“It’ll be Ravenclaw,” said Harry heavily. 
“Good . . . good . . .” said Hagrid distractedly. “Tha’s good. . . .” 
They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn, 
looking around with every other step. When they reached his cabin, 
Hermione turned automatically left toward the front door; Hagrid, 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 686  
however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the out-
ermost edge of the forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was 
leaning against a tree. When he realized they were no longer with him, 
he turned. 
“We’re goin’ in here,” he said, jerking his shaggy head behind him. 
“Into the forest?” said Hermione, perplexed. 
“Yeah,” said Hagrid. “C’mon now, quick, before we’re spotted!” 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the 
cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from 
them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and 
Hermione ran to catch up with him. 
“Hagrid, why are you armed?” said Harry. 
“Jus’ a precaution,” said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders. 
“You didn’t bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thes-
trals,” said Hermione timidly. 
“Nah, well, we weren’ goin’ in so far then,” said Hagrid. “An’ any-
way, tha’ was before Firenze left the forest, wasn’ it?” 
“Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?” asked Hermione 
curiously. 
“ ’Cause the other centaurs are good an’ riled at me, tha’s why,” said 
Hagrid quietly, glancing around. “They used ter be — well, yeh 
couldn’ call ’em friendly — but we got on all righ’. Kept ’emselves to 
’emselves, bu’ always turned up if I wanted a word. Not anymore . . .” 
He sighed deeply. 
“Firenze said that they’re angry because he went to work for Dum-
bledore?” Harry asked, tripping on a protruding root because he was 
busy watching Hagrid’s profile. 
“Yeah,” said Hagrid heavily. “Well, angry doesn’ cover it. Ruddy 
livid. If I hadn’ stepped in, I reckon they’d’ve kicked Firenze ter 
death —” 
“They attacked him?” said Hermione, sounding shocked. 
 
GRAWP 
 687  
“Yep,” said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-
hanging branches. “He had half the herd onto him —” 
“And you stopped it?” said Harry, amazed and impressed. “By 
yourself?” 
“ ’Course I did, couldn’t stand by an’ watch ’em kill him, could I?” 
said Hagrid. “Lucky I was passin’, really . . . an’ I’d’ve thought Firenze 
mighta remembered tha’ before he started sendin’ me stupid warnin’s!” 
he added hotly and unexpectedly. 
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, 
scowling, did not elaborate. 
“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, “since 
then the other centaurs’ve bin livid with me an’ the trouble is, they’ve 
got a lot of influence in the forest. . . . Cleverest creatures in here . . .” 
“Is that why we’re here, Hagrid?” asked Hermione. “The centaurs?” 
“Ah no,” said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, “no, it’s not 
them. . . . Well, o’ course, they could complicate the problem, yeah. 
. . . But yeh’ll see what I mean in a bit. . . .” 
On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little 
ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great 
trouble keeping up with him. 
The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew 
so closely together as they walked farther and farther into the forest 
that it was as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way past the clear-
ing where Hagrid had shown them the thestrals, but Harry felt no 
sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and 
began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of 
the forest. 
“Hagrid?” said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted 
brambles over which Hagrid had stepped easily and remembering 
very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasions he had 
stepped off the forest path. “Where are we going?” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 688  
“Bit further,” said Hagrid over his shoulder. “C’mon, Harry. . . . 
We need ter keep together now. . . .” 
It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches 
and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as 
though they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione’s 
robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for 
minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry’s arms and legs were soon 
covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the forest 
now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a 
massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the 
muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest 
rustle of movement, though it might have been made by an innocent 
sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It 
occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the for-
est without meeting some kind of creature — their absence struck him 
as rather ominous. 
“Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands?” said Hermione 
quietly. 
“Er . . . all righ’,” Hagrid whispered back. “In fact . . .” 
He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right 
into him and was knocked over backward. Harry caught her just be-
fore she hit the forest floor. 
“Maybe we bes’ jus’ stop fer a momen’, so I can . . . fill yeh in,” said 
Hagrid. “Before we ge’ there, like.” 
“Good!” said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet. They 
both murmured “Lumos!” and their wand tips ignited. Hagrid’s face 
swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and 
Harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again. 
“Righ,” said Hagrid. “Well . . . see . . . the thing is . . .” 
He took a great breath. 
“Well, there’s a good chance I’m goin’ ter be gettin’ the sack any day 
now,” he said. 
GRAWP 
 689  
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him. 
“But you’ve lasted this long —” Hermione said tentatively. “What 
makes you think —” 
“Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha’ niffler in her office.” 
“And was it?” said Harry, before he could stop himself. 
“No, it ruddy well wasn’!” said Hagrid indignantly. “On’y anythin’ 
ter do with magical creatures an’ she thinks it’s got somethin’ ter do 
with me. Yeh know she’s bin lookin’ fer a chance ter get rid of me ever 
since I got back. I don’ wan’ ter go, o’ course, but if it wasn’ fer . . . 
well . . . the special circumstances I’m abou’ ter explain to yeh, I’d 
leave righ now, before she’s go’ the chance ter do it in front o’ the 
whole school, like she did with Trelawney.” 
Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid 
overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands. 
“It’s not the end o’ the world, I’ll be able ter help Dumbledore once 
I’m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An’ you lot’ll have 
Grubbly-Plank, yeh’ll — yeh’ll get through yer exams fine. . . .” His 
voice trembled and broke. 
“Don’ worry abou’ me,” he said hastily, as Hermione made to pat 
his arm. He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the 
pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it. “Look, I wouldn’ 
be tellin’ yer this at all if I didn’ have ter. See, if I go . . . well, I can’ 
leave withou’ . . . withou’ tellin’ someone . . . because I’ll — I’ll need 
you two ter help me. An’ Ron, if he’s willin’.” 
“Of course we’ll help you,” said Harry at once. “What do you want 
us to do?” 
Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoul-
der with such force that Harry was knocked sideways into a tree. 
“I knew yeh’d say yes,” said Hagrid into his handkerchief, “but I 
won’ . . . never . . . forget . . . Well . . . c’mon . . . jus’ a little bit fur-
ther through here . . . Watch yerselves, now, there’s nettles. . . .” 
They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes. Harry had 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 690  
opened his mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when Ha-
grid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop. 
“Really easy,” he said softly. “Very quiet, now . . .” 
They crept forward and Harry saw that they were facing a large, 
smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with 
a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal. Trees 
had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood 
on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs 
that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry, 
Hermione, and Hagrid now stood. 
“Sleepin’,” breathed Hagrid. 
Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that 
sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work. He glanced sideways 
at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly 
open. She looked utterly terrified. 
“Hagrid,” she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the 
sleeping creature, “who is he?” 
Harry found this an odd question. . . . “What is it?” was the one he 
had been planning on asking. 
“Hagrid, you told us,” said Hermione, her wand now shaking in 
her hand, “you told us none of them wanted to come!” 
Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realization hit him, 
he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror. 
The great mound of earth, on which he, Hermione, and Hagrid 
could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with 
the deep, grunting breathing. It was not a mound at all. It was the 
curved back of what was clearly . . . 
“Well — no — he didn’ want ter come,” said Hagrid, sounding 
desperate. “But I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter!” 
“But why?” asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted 
to cry. “Why — what — oh, Hagrid!” 
“I knew if I jus’ got him back,” said Hagrid, sounding close to tears 
GRAWP 
 691  
himself, “an’ — an’ taught him a few manners — I’d be able ter take 
him outside an’ show ev’ryone he’s harmless!” 
“Harmless!” said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hush-
ing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them 
grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep. “He’s been hurting you all this 
time, hasn’t he? That’s why you’ve had all these injuries!” 
“He don’ know his own strength!” said Hagrid earnestly. “An’ he’s 
gettin’ better, he’s not fightin’ so much anymore —” 
“So this is why it took you two months to get home!” said 
Hermione distractedly. “Oh Hagrid, why did you bring him back if 
he didn’t want to come, wouldn’t he have been happier with his own 
people?” 
“They were all bullyin’ him, Hermione, ’cause he’s so small!” said 
Hagrid. 
“Small?” said Hermione. “Small ?” 
“Hermione, I couldn’ leave him,” said Hagrid, tears now trickling 
down his bruised face into his beard. “See — he’s my brother!” 
Hermione simply stared at him, her mouth open. 
“Hagrid, when you say ‘brother,’ ”  said Harry slowly, “do you 
mean — ?” 
“Well — half-brother,” amended Hagrid. “Turns out me mother 
took up with another giant when she left me dad, an’ she went an’ had 
Grawp here —” 
“Grawp?” said Harry. 
“Yeah . . . well, tha’s what it sounds like when he says his name,” 
said Hagrid anxiously. “He don’ speak a lot of English. . . . I’ve bin 
tryin’ ter teach him. . . . Anyway, she don’ seem ter have liked him 
much more’n she liked me. . . . See, with giantesses, what counts is 
producin’ good big kids, and he’s always been a bit on the runty side 
fer a giant — on’y sixteen foot —” 
“Oh yes, tiny!” said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm. 
“Absolutely minuscule!” 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 692  
“He was bein’ kicked around by all o’ them — I jus’ couldn’ leave 
him —” 
“Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back?” asked Harry. 
“She — well, she could see it was right importan’ ter me,” said Ha-
grid, twisting his enormous hands. “Bu’ — bu’ she got a bit tired of 
him after a while, I must admit . . . so we split up on the journey 
home. . . . She promised not ter tell anyone though. . . .” 
“How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing?” 
said Harry. 
“Well, tha’s why it took so long, see,” said Hagrid. “Could on’y 
travel by nigh an’ through wild country an’ stuff. ’Course, he covers 
the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep’ wantin’ ter go 
back. . . .” 
“Oh Hagrid, why on earth didn’t you let him!” said Hermione, 
flopping down onto a ripped-up tree and burying her face in her 
hands. “What do you think you’re going to do with a violent giant 
who doesn’t even want to be here!” 
“Well, now — ‘violent’ — tha’s a bit harsh,” said Hagrid, still 
twisting his hands agitatedly. “I’ll admit he mighta taken a couple o’ 
swings at me when he’s bin in a bad mood, but he’s gettin’ better, loads 
better, settlin’ down well. . . .” 
“What are those ropes for, then?” Harry asked. 
He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around 
the trunks of the largest nearby trees toward the place where Grawp 
lay curled on the ground with his back to them. 
“You have to keep him tied up?” said Hermione faintly. 
“Well . . . yeah . . .” said Hagrid, looking anxious. “See — it’s like I 
say — he doesn’ really know his strength —” 
Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack 
of any other living creature in this part of the forest. 
“So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?” Hermione 
asked apprehensively. 
GRAWP 
 693  
“Look after him,” said Hagrid croakily. “After I’m gone.” 
Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncom-
fortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do 
whatever he asked. 
“What — what does that involve, exactly?” Hermione inquired. 
“Not food or anythin’!” said Hagrid eagerly. “He can get his own 
food, no problem. Birds an’ deer an’ stuff . . . No, it’s company he 
needs. If I jus’ knew someone was carryin’ on tryin’ ter help him a bit 
. . . teachin’ him, yeh know . . .” 
Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form 
lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Grawp had his back to 
them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like a very oversize hu-
man, Grawp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to 
be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he 
now recognized as Grawp’s head. It was much larger in proportion to 
the body than a human head, almost perfectly round and covered 
with tightly curling, close-growing hair the color of bracken. The 
rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which 
seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon’s, directly upon the shoulders 
with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like 
a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly to-
gether, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a lit-
tle at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under 
the body; Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, 
large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest 
floor. 
“You want us to teach him,” Harry said in a hollow voice. He now 
understood what Firenze’s warning had meant. His attempt is not work-
ing. He would do better to abandon it. Of course, the other creatures 
who lived in the forest would have heard Hagrid’s fruitless attempts to 
teach Grawp English. . . . 
“Yeah — even if yeh jus’ talk ter him a bit,” said Hagrid hopefully. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 694  
“ ’Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he’ll understand more that 
we all like him really, an’ want him to stay. . . .” 
Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between 
the fingers over her face. 
“Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn’t it?” he said 
and she gave a very shaky laugh. 
“Yeh’ll do it, then?” said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught 
what Harry had just said. 
“We’ll . . .” said Harry, already bound by his promise. “We’ll try, 
Hagrid. . . .” 
“I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,” Hagrid said, beaming in a 
very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again. 
“An’ I don’ wan’ yeh ter put yerself out too much, like. . . . I know 
yeh’ve got exams. . . . If yeh could jus’ nip down here in yer Invisibil-
ity Cloak maybe once a week an’ have a little chat with him . . . I’ll 
wake him up, then — introduce you —” 
“Wha — no!” said Hermione, jumping up, “Hagrid, no, don’t 
wake him, really, we don’t need —” 
But Hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of 
them and was proceeding toward Grawp. When he was around ten 
feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled re-
assuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, and then poked 
Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough. 
The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest. Birds in 
the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared 
away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp 
was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enor-
mous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head 
to see who and what had disturbed him. 
“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, back-
ing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. 
“Had a nice sleep, eh?” 
GRAWP 
 695  
Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keep-
ing the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he 
had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face, 
which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the 
clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn onto a great 
stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided 
and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks. The small 
eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed 
together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles as big as cricket balls 
to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself 
to his feet with surprising speed and agility. 
“Oh my . . .” Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him. 
The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp’s 
wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid 
had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, he reached 
out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird’s nest from the 
upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a 
roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it — eggs fell 
like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his 
head to protect himself. 
“Anyway, Grawpy,” shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in 
case of further falling eggs, “I’ve brought some friends ter meet yeh. 
Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have 
ter go on a little trip an’ leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Re-
member that, Grawpy?” 
But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say 
whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the 
sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of 
the pine tree and was pulling it toward him, evidently for the simple 
pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go. 
“Now, Grawpy, don’ do that!” shouted Hagrid. “Tha’s how you 
ended up pullin’ up the others —” 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 696  
And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree’s roots 
beginning to crack. 
“I got company fer yeh!” Hagrid shouted. “Company, see! Look 
down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!” 
“Oh Hagrid, don’t,” moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already 
raised the bough again and gave Grawp’s knee a sharp poke. 
The giant let go of the top of the pine tree, which swayed menac-
ingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down. 
“This,” said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione 
stood, “is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh’ be comin’ ter visit 
yeh if I have ter go away, understand?” 
The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were 
there. They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boul-
der of a head so that he could peer blearily at them. 
“An’ this is Hermione, see? Her —” Hagrid hesitated. Turning to 
Hermione he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermi-
one? On’y it’s a difficult name fer him ter remember. . . .” 
“No, not at all,” squeaked Hermione. 
“This is Hermy, Grawp! An’ she’s gonna be comin’ an’ all! Is’n tha’ 
nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter — GRAWPY, NO!” 
Grawp’s hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione — Harry 
seized her and pulled her backward behind the tree, so that Grawp’s 
fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air. 
“BAD BOY, GRAWPY!” Harry heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione 
clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. “VERY 
BAD BOY! YEH DON’ GRAB — OUCH!” 
Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid 
lying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing in-
terest, had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling 
back the pine as far as it would go. 
“Righ’,” said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his  
 
GRAWP 
 697  
bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow. “Well . . . there 
yeh are. . . . Yeh’ve met him an’ — an’ now he’ll know yeh when yeh 
come back. Yeah . . . well . . .” 
He looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with 
an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face; the roots 
were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground. . . . 
“Well, I reckon tha’s enough fer one day,” said Hagrid. “We’ll — 
er — we’ll go back now, shall we?” 
Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his crossbow 
again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees. 
Nobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant 
crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last. 
Hermione’s face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single 
thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody 
found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the forest? And he had 
promised that he, Ron, and Hermione would continue Hagrid’s to-
tally pointless attempts to civilize the giant. . . . How could Hagrid, 
even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged mon-
sters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit 
to mix with humans? 
“Hold it,” said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were 
struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him. He pulled 
an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the 
crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had 
stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by. 
“Oh blimey,” said Hagrid quietly. 
“I thought that we told you, Hagrid,” said a deep male voice, “that 
you are no longer welcome here?” 
A man’s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward 
them through the dappled green half-light. Then they saw that his 
waist joined smoothly with a horse’s chestnut body. This centaur had  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 698  
a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he 
was armed: A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over his 
shoulders. 
“How are yeh, Magorian?” said Hagrid warily. 
The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged 
behind him. Harry recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane, 
whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met 
Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before. 
“So,” he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning 
immediately to Magorian. “We agreed, I think, what we would do if 
this human showed his face in the forest again?” 
“ ‘This human’ now, am I?” said Hagrid testily. “Jus’ fer stoppin’ all 
of yeh committin’ murder?” 
“You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,” said Magorian. “Our 
ways are not yours, nor are our laws. Firenze has betrayed and dis-
honored us.” 
“I dunno how yeh work that out,” said Hagrid impatiently. “He’s 
done nothin’ except help Albus Dumbledore —” 
“Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,” said a gray centaur 
with a hard, deeply lined face. 
“Servitude!” said Hagrid scathingly. “He’s doin’ Dumbledore a favor 
is all —” 
“He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,” said 
Magorian quietly. “There can be no return from such disgrace.” 
“If yeh say so,” said Hagrid, shrugging, “but personally I think 
yeh’re makin’ a big mistake —” 
“As are you, human,” said Bane, “coming back into our forest when 
we warned you —” 
“Now, you listen ter me,” said Hagrid angrily. “I’ll have less of the 
‘our’ forest, if it’s all the same ter you. It’s not up ter you who comes 
an’ goes in here —” 
 
GRAWP 
 699  
“No more is it up to you, Hagrid,” said Magorian smoothly. “I shall 
let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young —” 
“They’re not his!” interrupted Bane contemptuously. “Students, 
Magorian, from up at the school! They have probably already profited 
from the traitor Firenze’s teachings. . . .” 
“Nevertheless,” said Magorian calmly, “the slaughter of foals is a 
terrible crime. . . . We do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you 
pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friend-
ship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.” 
“I won’ be kept outta the fores’ by a bunch of mules like you!” said 
Hagrid loudly. 
“Hagrid,” said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as 
both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, “let’s go, please 
lets go! 
Hagrid moved forward, but his crossbow was still raised and his 
eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian. 
“We know what you are keeping in the forest, Hagrid!” Magorian 
called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. “And our toler-
ance is waning!” 
Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk 
straight back to Magorian again. 
“You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s here, it’s as much his forest as 
yours!” he yelled, while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all 
their might against Hagrid’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep 
him moving forward. Still scowling, he looked down; his expression 
changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him. He 
seemed not to have felt it. 
“Calm down, you two,” he said, turning to walk on while they 
panted along behind him. “Ruddy old nags though, eh?” 
“Hagrid,” said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles 
they had passed on their way there, “if the centaurs don’t want  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 700  
humans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though Harry and I will 
be able —” 
“Ah, you heard what they said,” said Hagrid dismissively “They 
wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids. Anyway, we can’ let ourselves be 
pushed around by that lot. . . .” 
“Nice try,” Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen. 
At last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes, the 
trees began to thin. They were able to see patches of clear blue sky 
again and hear, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and 
shouting. 
“Was that another goal?” asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of 
the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. “Or d’you reckon 
the match is over?” 
“I don’t know,” said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked 
much the worse for wear; her hair was full of bits of twig and leaves, 
her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous 
scratches on her face and arms. He knew he could look little better. 
“I reckon it’s over, yeh know!” said Hagrid, still squinting toward 
the stadium. “Look — there’s people comin’ out already — if you two 
hurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an’ no one’ll know you 
weren’t there!” 
“Good idea,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later, then, Hagrid. . . .” 
“I don’t believe him,” said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the 
moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. “I don’t believe him. I 
really don’t believe him. . . .” 
“Calm down,” said Harry. 
“Calm down!” she said feverishly. “A giant! A giant in the forest! 
And we’re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of 
course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in 
and out! I — don’t — believe — him!” 
“We haven’t got to do anything yet!” Harry tried to reassure her in  
 
GRAWP 
 701  
a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading 
back toward the castle. “He’s not asking us to do anything unless he 
gets chucked out and that might not even happen —” 
“Oh come off it, Harry!” said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in 
her tracks so that the people behind her had to swerve to avoid her. 
“Of course he’s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, af-
ter what we’ve just seen, who can blame Umbridge?” 
There was a pause in which Harry glared at her, and her eyes filled 
slowly with tears. 
“You didn’t mean that,” said Harry quietly. 
“No . . . well . . . all right . . . I didn’t,” she said, wiping her eyes 
angrily. “But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself — 
for us?” 
“I dunno —” 
 
Weasley is our King, 
Weasley is our King, 
He didn’t let the Quaffle in, 
Weasley is our King . . . 
 
“And I wish they’d stop singing that stupid song,” said Hermione 
miserably, “haven’t they gloated enough?” 
A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the 
pitch. 
“Oh, let’s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,” said 
Hermione. 
 
Weasley can save anything, 
He never leaves a single ring 
That’s why Gryffindors all sing: 
Weasley is our King. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY 
 702  
“Hermione . . .” said Harry slowly. 
The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd 
of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold 
moving slowly toward the castle, which was bearing a solitary figure 
upon its many shoulders. . . . 
 
Weasley is our King, 
Weasley is our King, 
He didn’t let the Quaffle in, 
Weasley is our King . . . 
 
“No!” said Hermione in a hushed voice. 
“YES!” said Harry loudly. 
“HARRY! HERMIONE!” yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch 
Cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. “WE DID IT! WE 
WON!” 
They beamed up at him as he passed; there was a scrum at the door 
of the castle and Ron’s head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but 
nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd 
squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight. Harry and 
Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of 
“Weasley Is Our King” died away. Then they turned to each other, 
their smiles fading. 
“We’ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?” said Harry. 
“Yes, all right,” said Hermione wearily. “I’m not in any hurry. . . .” 
They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinc-
tively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure 
whether it was his imagination or not, but he rather thought he saw a 
small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the treetops in the dis-
tance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had 
just been pulled up by the roots.

on’s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup 
was such that he could not settle to anything next day. All he 
wanted to do was talk over the match and Harry and Hermione found 
it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp — not 
that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to 
bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was an-
other fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in studying 
under the beech tree on the edge of the lake, where they stood less 
chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not 
particularly keen on this idea at first; he was thoroughly enjoying be-
ing patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past his chair, not to 
mention the occasional outbursts of “Weasley Is Our King,” but 
agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good. 
They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat 
down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for 
what felt like the dozenth time. 
“Well, I mean, I’d already let in that one of Davies’s, so I wasn’t feel-
ing that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came toward me, just

out of nowhere, I thought — you can do this! And I had about a sec-
ond to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he 
was aiming for the right goal hoop — my right, obviously, his left — 
but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the 
chance and flew left — his right, I mean — and — well — you saw 
what happened,” he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite 
unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing 
around to see whether the people nearest to them — a bunch of gos-
siping third-year Hufflepuffs — had heard him. “And then, when 
Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what?” Ron said, 
stopping mid-sentence at the look on Harry’s face. “Why are you 
grinning?” 
“I’m not,” said Harry quickly, looking down at his Transfiguration 
notes and attempting to straighten his face. The truth was that Ron 
had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch 
player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. “I’m 
just glad we won, that’s all.” 
“Yeah,” said Ron slowly, savoring the words, “we won. Did you see 
the look on Chang’s face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from 
under her nose?” 
“I suppose she cried, did she?” said Harry bitterly. 
“Well, yeah — more out of temper than anything, though . . .” 
Ron frowned slightly. “But you saw her chuck her broom away when 
she got back to the ground, didn’t you?” 
“Er —” said Harry. 
“Well, actually . . . no, Ron,” said Hermione with a heavy sigh, 
putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. “As a mat-
ter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies’s first 
goal.” 
Ron’s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. 
“You didn’t watch?” he said faintly, looking from one to the other. 
“You didn’t see me make any of those saves?” 
O.W.L.S 
 705  
“Well — no,” said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand to-
ward him. “But Ron, we didn’t want to leave — we had to!” 
“Yeah?” said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. “How come?” 
“It was Hagrid,” said Harry. “He decided to tell us why he’s been 
covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted 
us to go into the forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he 
gets. . . . Anyway . . .” 
The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron’s in-
dignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity. 
“He brought one back and hid it in the forest?” 
“Yep,” said Harry grimly. 
“No,” said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. 
“No, he can’t have. . . .” 
“Well, he has,” said Hermione firmly. “Grawp’s about sixteen feet 
tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,” she 
snorted, “as Hermy.” 
Ron gave a nervous laugh. 
“And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?” 
“Teach him English, yeah,” said Harry. 
“He’s lost his mind,” said Ron in an almost awed voice. 
“Yes,” said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate 
Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl 
turning into a pair of opera glasses. “Yes, I’m starting to think he has. 
But unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.” 
“Well, you’re just going to have to break your promise, that’s all,” 
said Ron firmly. “I mean, come on . . . We’ve got exams and we’re 
about that far,” he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a 
millimeter apart, “from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . re-
member Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better 
for mixing with any of Hagrid’s monster mates?” 
“I know, it’s just that — we promised,” said Hermione in a small 
voice. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 706  
Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied. 
“Well,” he sighed, “Hagrid hasn’t been sacked yet, has he? He’s 
hung on this long, maybe he’ll hang on till the end of term and we 
won’t have to go near Grawp at all.” 
 
The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly 
painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling 
lake, the satin-green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze: June 
had arrived, but to the fifth years this meant only one thing: Their 
O.W.L.s were upon them at last. 
Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons 
were devoted to reviewing those topics their teachers thought most 
likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere 
drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from Harry’s mind, though 
he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had 
ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Occlumency 
tuition: If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he 
was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite 
busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his re-
lief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him 
about Occlumency. She was spending a lot of time muttering to her-
self and had not laid out any elf clothes for days. 
She was not the only person acting oddly as the O.W.L.s drew 
steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of 
interrogating people about their study habits. 
“How many hours d’you think you’re doing a day?” he demanded 
of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam 
in his eyes. 
“I dunno,” said Ron. “A few . . .” 
“More or less than eight?” 
“Less, I s’pose,” said Ron, looking slightly alarmed. 
“I’m doing eight,” said Ernie, puffing out his chest. “Eight or nine. 
O.W.L.S 
 707  
I’m getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eight’s my average. 
I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. 
Not so good on Tuesday — only seven and a quarter. Then on 
Wednesday —” 
Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into 
greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital. 
Meanwhile Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce 
panic. 
“Of course, it’s not what you know,” he was heard to tell Crabbe 
and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to 
start, “it’s who you know. Now, Father’s been friendly with the head of 
the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda 
Marchbanks — we’ve had her round for dinner and everything. . . .” 
“Do you think that’s true?” Hermione whispered to Harry and 
Ron, looking frightened. 
“Nothing we can do about it if it is,” said Ron gloomily. 
“I don’t think it’s true,” said Neville quietly from behind them. 
“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran’s, and she’s never 
mentioned the Malfoys.” 
“What’s she like, Neville?” asked Hermione at once. “Is she strict?” 
“Bit like Gran, really,” said Neville in a subdued voice. 
“Knowing her won’t hurt your chances though, will it?” Ron told 
him encouragingly. 
“Oh, I don’t think it will make any difference,” said Neville, still more 
miserably. “Gran’s always telling Professor Marchbanks I’m not as good 
as my dad. . . . Well . . . you saw what she’s like at St. Mungo’s. . . .” 
Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
glanced at one another, but didn’t know what to say. It was the first 
time that Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the Wizard-
ing hospital. 
Meanwhile a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentra-
tion, mental agility, and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 708  
and seventh years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle 
of Baruffio’s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth year Ed-
die Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 
“Outstanding” O.W.L.s he had gained the previous summer and was 
offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry 
he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts 
and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had 
confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents 
down a toilet. 
“Hermione, we wanted to buy that!” shouted Ron. 
“Don’t be stupid,” she snarled. “You might as well take Harold 
Dingle’s powdered dragon claw and have done with it.” 
“Dingle’s got powdered dragon claw?” said Ron eagerly. 
“Not anymore,” said Hermione. “I confiscated that too. None of 
these things actually works you know —” 
“Dragon claw does work!” said Ron. “It’s supposed to be incredible, 
really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few 
hours — Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt —” 
“This stuff can,” said Hermione grimly. “I’ve had a look at it, and 
it’s actually dried doxy droppings.” 
This information took the edge off Harry and Ron’s desire for brain 
stimulants. 
They received their examination schedules and details of the proce-
dure for O.W.L.s during their next Transfiguration lesson. 
“As you can see,” Professor McGonagall told the class while they 
copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, 
“your O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the 
theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. 
Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at 
night. 
“Now, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti-Cheating 
Charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer 
O.W.L.S 
 709  
Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, 
Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am 
afraid to say, seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he 
or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority’s rules. 
I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new — head-
mistress” — Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the 
same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was con-
templating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt — “has asked the Heads 
of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most se-
verely — because, of course, your examination results will reflect 
upon the headmistress’s new regime at the school. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh. Harry saw the nostrils of 
her sharp nose flare. 
“However, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your 
own futures to think about.” 
“Please, Professor,” said Hermione, her hand in the air, “when will 
we find out our results?” 
“An owl will be sent to you some time in July,” said Professor 
McGonagall. 
“Excellent,” said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, “so we don’t 
have to worry about it till the holidays. . . .” 
Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks’ 
time, waiting for his O.W.L. results. Well, he thought, at least he 
would be sure of one bit of post next summer. . . . 
Their first exam, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday 
morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday but 
regretted it almost at once. She was very agitated and kept snatching 
the book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer com-
pletely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge 
of Achievements in Charming. 
“Why don’t you just do it yourself?” he said firmly, handing the 
book back to her, his eyes watering. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 710  
Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his 
fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat 
on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive 
Charm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, 
Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic loco-
motion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around 
the edge of the table. 
Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk 
much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione on 
the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving un-
der the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check 
some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a de-
cent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from 
her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate. 
“Oh, my goodness,” she said faintly, staring into the entrance hall. 
“Is that them? Is that the examiners?” 
Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the 
doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a 
small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, 
Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous. 
“Shall we go and have a closer look?” said Ron. 
Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double 
doors into the entrance hall, slowing down as they stepped over the 
threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Profes-
sor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it 
looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was 
speaking to her very deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be 
a little deaf; she was answering Umbridge very loudly considering that 
they were only a foot apart. 
“Journey was fine, journey was fine, we’ve made it plenty of times 
before!” she said impatiently. “Now, I haven’t heard from Dumbledore 
lately!” she added, peering around the hall as though hopeful he might 
O.W.L.S 
 711  
suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. “No idea where he is, I 
suppose?” 
“None at all,” said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of 
the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. “But I daresay the 
Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough. . . .” 
“I doubt it,” shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, “not if Dumble-
dore doesn’t want to be found! I should know. . . . Examined him 
personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s . . . 
Did things with a wand I’d never seen before . . .” 
“Yes . . . well . . .” said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they 
dared, “let me show you to the staffroom . . . I daresay you’d like a cup 
of tea after your journey. . . .” 
It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to 
do some last-minute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very 
far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like 
hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall’s fu-
rious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was 
the last thing she did. . . . He wished he had expressed a more achiev-
able ambition now that exam time was here. . . . He knew that he was 
not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory 
spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep. 
None of the fifth years talked very much at breakfast next day ei-
ther. Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the 
salt cellar in front of her twitched, Hermione was rereading Achieve-
ment in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred, and Neville 
kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade. 
Once breakfast was over, the fifth and seventh years milled around 
in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons. Then, 
at half-past nine, they were called forward class by class to reenter the 
Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as Harry had seen it in 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 712  
the Pensieve when his father, Sirius, and Snape had been taking their 
O.W.L.s. The four House tables had been removed and replaced in-
stead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the 
Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were 
all seated and quiet she said, “You may begin,” and turned over an 
enormous hourglass on the desk beside her, on which were also spare 
quills, ink bottles, and rolls of parchment. 
Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard. . . . Three 
rows to his right and four seats ahead, Hermione was already scrib-
bling. . . . He lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incanta-
tion, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly. . . . 
Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and 
landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll. . . . Smiling slightly, he 
bent over the paper and began to write. . . . 
 
“Well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?” asked Hermione anxiously in the en-
trance hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. “I’m not 
sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of 
time — did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? I wasn’t sure 
whether I ought to, it felt like too much — and on question twenty-
three —” 
“Hermione,” said Ron sternly, “we’ve been through this before. . . . 
We’re not going through every exam afterward, it’s bad enough doing 
them once.” 
The fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four House 
tables reappeared over the lunch hour) and then trooped off into the 
small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until 
called for their practical examination. As small groups of students 
were called forward in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered 
incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one 
another in the back or eye by mistake. 
Hermione’s name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with 
O.W.L.S 
 713  
Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Stu-
dents who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry 
and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done. 
“She’ll be fine — remember she got a hundred and twelve percent 
on one of our Charms tests?” said Ron. 
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, “Parkinson, Pansy — 
Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter, Harry.” 
“Good luck,” said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, 
clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook. 
“Professor Tofty is free, Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who 
was standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry toward what 
looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting be-
hind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor 
Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy. 
“Potter, is it?” said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering 
over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached. “The famous Potter?” 
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a 
scathing look over at him; the wine glass Malfoy had been levitating 
fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin. Profes-
sor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly. 
“That’s it,” he said in his quavery old voice, “no need to be nervous. 
. . . Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some 
cartwheels for me. . . .” 
On the whole Harry thought it went rather well; his Levitation 
Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy’s had been, though he 
wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color-Change and 
Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange 
swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could 
rectify his mistake. He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at 
the time and neglected to mention it to her afterward. He could tell 
Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large 
mushroom and had no idea how it had happened. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 714  
There was no time to relax that night — they went straight to the 
common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for 
Transfiguration next day. Harry went to bed, his head buzzing with 
complex spell models and theories. 
He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written 
exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot 
worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas 
poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and 
somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, 
causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds 
were captured and carried out of the Hall. 
They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small 
bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably 
well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for 
the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with 
any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the 
practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defen-
sive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from 
near the doors into the entrance hall. 
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, 
when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very 
good indeed! Well, I think that’s all, Potter . . . unless . . .” 
He leaned forward a little. 
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can pro-
duce a Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?” 
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined 
her being sacked. 
“Expecto Patronum!” 
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the 
length of the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its 
progress and when it dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty 
clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically. 
O.W.L.S 
 715  
“Excellent!” he said. “Very well, Potter, you may go!” 
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met. There 
was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did 
not care. Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning 
on saying it to anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an “Out-
standing” O.W.L. 
On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat 
her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front 
of them, they permitted themselves a break from studying. They 
stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm 
summer air wafted over them as they played a desultory game of wiz-
ard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on 
the edge of the forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were 
examining — he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys 
seemed to be standing back a little — when the portrait hole opened 
and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered. 
“How were the runes?” said Ron, yawning and stretching. 
“I mistranslated ‘ehwaz,’ ” said Hermione furiously. “It means ‘part-
nership,’ not ‘defense,’ I mixed it up with ‘eihwaz.’” 
“Ah well,” said Ron lazily, “that’s only one mistake, isn’t it, you’ll 
still get —” 
“Oh shut up,” said Hermione angrily, “it could be the one mistake 
that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what’s more, 
someone’s put another niffler in Umbridge’s office, I don’t know how 
they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and 
Umbridge is shrieking her head off — by the sound of it, it tried to 
take a chunk out of her leg —” 
“Good,” said Harry and Ron together. 
“It is not good!” said Hermione hotly. “She thinks it’s Hagrid doing 
it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!” 
“He’s teaching at the moment, she can’t blame him,” said Harry, 
gesturing out of the window. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 716  
“Oh, you’re so naive sometimes, Harry, you really think Umbridge 
will wait for proof?” said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in 
a towering temper, and she swept off toward the girls’ dormitories, 
banging the door behind her. 
“Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,” said Ron, very quietly, prod-
ding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of 
Harry’s knights. 
Hermione’s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though 
Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of 
Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to 
which Harry was looking forward least and which he was sure would 
be the one that would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an 
Auror. Sure enough, he found the written exam difficult, though he 
thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice 
Potion: He could describe its effects extremely accurately, having 
taken it illegally in his second year. 
The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to 
be. With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was 
much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville, 
who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had 
ever seen him during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks 
said, “Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,” 
Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved 
a good grade but that he had, with luck, avoided a fail. 
“Only four exams left,” said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed 
back to Gryffindor common room. 
“Only!” said Hermione snappishly. “I’ve got Arithmancy and it’s 
probably the toughest subject there is!” 
Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent 
her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first 
years for giggling too loudly in the common room. 
 
O.W.L.S

Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday’s Care of Magi-
cal Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The practical exam-
ination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the 
Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify 
the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer 
them all milk in turn: knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills 
had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw 
as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of 
a bowtruckle, feed and clean a fire-crab without sustaining serious 
burns, and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would 
give a sick unicorn. 
Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin win-
dow. When Harry’s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at 
him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting 
thumbs-up before heading back up to the castle. 
The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well 
enough; Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of 
Jupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was 
inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical 
Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination. 
Even by Harry’s low standards in Divination, the exam went very 
badly. He might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desk-
top as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely 
during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor 
Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, 
and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines 
on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previ-
ous Tuesday. 
“Well, we were always going to fail that one,” said Ron gloomily as 
they ascended the marble staircase. He had just made Harry feel 
rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 718  
the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look 
up and realize he had been describing his examiner’s reflection. 
“We shouldn’t have taken the stupid subject in the first place,” said 
Harry. 
“Still, at least we can give it up now.” 
“Yeah,” said Harry. “No more pretending we care what happens 
when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly . . .” 
“And from now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die — 
I’m just chucking them in the bin where they belong.” 
Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them. 
He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her. 
“Well, I think I’ve done all right in Arithmancy,” she said, and 
Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. “Just time for a quick look 
over our star charts before dinner, then . . .” 
When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven 
o’clock they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still. 
The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight, and there was a slight 
chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when 
Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank 
star chart he or she had been given. 
Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching 
as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were 
observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occa-
sional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scrib-
bling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then an hour; the little 
squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started 
to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished. 
As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however, 
the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where 
he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way 
across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment  
 
O.W.L.S 
 719  
to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows 
moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the 
lawn became a sea of darkness once more. 
Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now ex-
amining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, 
but something distracted him. Pausing with his quill suspended over 
the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw 
half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been mov-
ing, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, 
they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on 
which they stood. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling 
that he recognized the walk of the squattest among them, who seemed 
to be leading the group. 
He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside 
past midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then some-
body coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway 
through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus’s position — jam-
ming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was again on the 
point of entering it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he 
heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted grounds, fol-
lowed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog. 
He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Ha-
grid’s windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were 
now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw 
six tiny but sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door 
closed again and there was silence. 
Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or 
Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came 
walking behind him at that moment, and not wanting to appear as 
though he was sneaking looks at anyone else’s work, he hastily bent 
over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 720  
peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrid’s cabin. Figures were 
now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light. 
He could feel Professor Marchbanks’s eyes on the back of his neck 
and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon 
though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor 
Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that 
echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. 
Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their 
telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin. 
Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough. 
“Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,” he said softly. 
Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left. 
Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid’s. 
“Ahem — twenty minutes to go,” said Professor Tofty. 
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart; Harry 
looked down at his own and noticed that he had mislabelled Venus as 
Mars. He bent to correct it. 
There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people said 
“Ouch!” as they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their 
telescopes, hastening to see what was going on below. 
Hagrid’s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the 
cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and bran-
dishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by 
the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed 
to be attempting to Stun him. 
“No!” cried Hermione. 
“My dear!” said Professor Tofty in a scandalized voice. “This is an 
examination!” 
But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star charts 
anymore: Jets of red light were still flying beside Hagrid’s cabin, yet 
somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him. He was still upright  
 
O.W.L.S 
 721  
and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed 
across the grounds; a man yelled, “Be reasonable, Hagrid!” and Hagrid 
roared, “Reasonable be damned, yeh won’ take me like this, Dawlish!” 
Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Ha-
grid, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell 
caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, 
lifted the culprit bodily from the ground, and threw him: The man 
flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione 
gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked around at Ron and 
saw that he too was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Ha-
grid in a real temper before. . . . 
“Look!” squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and 
pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors seemed to have 
opened again; more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a sin-
gle long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn. 
“Now, really!” said Professor Tofty anxiously. “Only sixteen min-
utes left, you know!” 
But nobody paid him the slightest attention: They were watching 
the person now sprinting toward the battle beside Hagrid’s cabin. 
“How dare you!” the figure shouted as she ran. “How dare you!” 
“It’s McGonagall!” whispered Hermione. 
“Leave him alone! Alone, I say!” said Professor McGonagall’s voice 
through the darkness. “On what grounds are you attacking him? He 
has done nothing, nothing to warrant such —” 
Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender all screamed. No fewer than four 
Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor 
McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams col-
lided with her. For a moment she looked luminous, illuminated by an 
eerie red glow, then was lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her 
back, and moved no more. 
“Galloping gargoyles!” shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 722  
have forgotten the exam completely. “Not so much as a warning! Out-
rageous behavior!” 
“COWARDS!” bellowed Hagrid, his voice carrying clearly to the 
top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle. 
“RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O’ THAT — AN’ THAT —” 
“Oh my —” gasped Hermione. 
Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by 
their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw him 
double over and thought for a moment that he had finally been over-
come by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was stand-
ing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back — then Harry 
realized that Fang’s limp body was draped around his shoulders. 
“Get him, get him!” screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper 
seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid’s fists. Indeed, 
he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious 
colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with 
Fang still hung around his neck; Umbridge sent one last Stunning 
Spell after him but it missed, and Hagrid, running full-pelt toward the 
distant gates, disappeared into the darkness. 
There was a long minute’s quivering silence, everybody gazing 
openmouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty’s voice said fee-
bly, “Um . . . five minutes to go, everybody . . .” 
Though he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was 
desperate for the end of the exam. When it came at last he, Ron, and 
Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders 
and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were 
going to bed — they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot 
of the stairs about what they had witnessed. 
“That evil woman!” gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having 
difficulty talking due to rage. “Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the 
dead of night!” 
 
O.W.L.S 
 723  
“She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney’s,” said 
Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them. 
“Hagrid did well, didn’t he?” said Ron, who looked more alarmed 
than impressed. “How come all the spells bounced off him?” 
“It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily. “It’s very hard to 
Stun a giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor 
McGonagall. . . . Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she’s not ex-
actly young, is she?” 
“Dreadful, dreadful,” said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. 
“Well, I’m off to bed. . . . ’Night, all . . .” 
People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about 
what they had just seen. 
“At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron. 
“I ’spect he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?” 
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. “Oh, this is aw-
ful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now 
we’ve lost Hagrid too. . . .” 
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. 
The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who 
had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had ar-
rived ahead of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, were now telling everyone 
what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower. 
“But why sack Hagrid now?” asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her 
head. “It’s not like Trelawney, he’s been teaching much better than 
usual this year!” 
“Umbridge hates part-humans,” said Hermione bitterly, flopping 
down into an armchair. “She was always going to try and get Hagrid 
out.” 
“And she thought Hagrid was putting nifflers in her office,” piped 
up Katie Bell. 
“Oh blimey,” said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. “It’s me’s been  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 724  
putting the nifflers in her office, Fred and George left me a couple, 
I’ve been levitating them in through her window. . . .” 
“She’d have sacked him anyway,” said Dean. “He was too close to 
Dumbledore.” 
“That’s true,” said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Her-
mione’s. 
“I just hope Professor McGonagall’s all right,” said Lavender tearfully. 
“They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dor-
mitory window,” said Colin Creevey “She didn’t look very well. . . .” 
“Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,” said Alicia Spinnet firmly. 
“She’s never failed yet.” 
It was nearly four in the morning before the common room 
cleared. Harry felt wide awake — the image of Hagrid sprinting away 
into the dark was haunting him. He was so angry with Umbridge he 
could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron’s 
suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts 
had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and 
arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested. 
Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that 
afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after 
breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-
minute studying, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the 
common room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through 
some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that Hermione 
had lent him. 
The fifth years entered the Great Hall at two o’clock and took their 
places in front of their overturned examination papers. Harry felt ex-
hausted. He just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep. 
Then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch 
pitch — he was going to have a fly on Ron’s broom and savor their 
freedom from studying. . . . 
 
O.W.L.S 
 725  
“Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks from the front 
of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. “You may begin. . . .” 
Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds be-
fore it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was 
a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows. Slowly, 
tortuously, he began to write an answer. 
He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept con-
fusing dates. He simply skipped question four: In your opinion, did 
wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of  
the eighteenth century? thinking that he would go back to it if he had 
time at the end. He had a stab at question five: How was the Statute of  
Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a 
recurrence? but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several im-
portant points. He had a feeling vampires had come into the story 
somewhere. . . . 
He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his 
eyes alighted upon number ten. 
Describe the circumstances that led to the Formation of the Interna-
tional Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liecht-
enstein refused to join. 
I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack. 
He could visualize a heading, in Hermione’s handwriting: The Forma-
tion of the International Confederation of Wizards. . . He had read these 
notes only this morning. . . . 
He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large 
hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sitting 
right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of 
her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden 
lights that glistened in it when she moved her head very slightly and 
had to give his own head a little shake to clear it. 
. . . the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE

of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, but his appointment was contested by 
the Wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because — 
All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurry-
ing, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head. 
What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liecht-
enstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls. . . . 
He gazed blankly at the back of Parvati’s head again. If he could only 
perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and 
see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre 
Bonaccord and Liechtenstein. . . . 
Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the 
glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted 
to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein 
was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain 
trolls. . . . That was it. . . . 
He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blaz-
ing-white parchment. Slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then 
read through what he had done so far. It did not seem very informa-
tive or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione’s notes on the confedera-
tion had gone on for pages and pages. . . . 
He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember. 
. . . The confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had 
written that already. . . . 
Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted. . . . He had written 
that too. . . . 
And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come . . . 
Think, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him 
quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled 
through the hourglass at the front. . . . 
He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of 
Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking  
 
O.W.L.S 
 727  
occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last. . . . 
The black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the 
circular room with its many doors. . . . 
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . . 
patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechan-
ical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry. . . . 
He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open 
just like the others. . . . 
Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and 
glass spheres. . . . His heart was beating very fast now. . . . He was go-
ing to get there this time. . . . When he reached number ninety-seven 
he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows. . . . 
But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape 
moving upon the floor like a wounded animal. . . . Harry’s stomach 
contracted with fear . . . with excitement. . . . 
A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of 
any human kindness, “Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I 
cannot touch it . . . but you can. . . .” 
The black shape upon the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-
fingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm 
. . . heard the high, cold voice say, “Crucio!” 
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand 
but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the 
curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless. 
“Lord Voldemort is waiting. . . .” 
Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his 
shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained 
and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance. . . . 
“You’ll have to kill me,” whispered Sirius. 
“Undoubtedly I shall in the end,” said the cold voice. “But you will 
fetch it for me first, Black. . . . You think you have felt pain thus far?  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-ONE 
 728  
Think again. . . . We have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you 
scream. . . .” 
But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again; 
somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk onto the cold stone 
floor. Harry hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, his scar on fire, as 
the Great Hall erupted all around him.

’m not going. . . . I don’t need the hospital wing. . . . I don’t 
want . . .” 
He was gibbering, trying to pull away from Professor Tofty, who 
was looking at him with much concern, and who had just helped 
Harry out into the entrance hall while the students all around them 
stared. 
“I’m — I’m fine, sir,” Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his 
face. “Really . . . I just fell asleep. . . . Had a nightmare . . .” 
“Pressure of examinations!” said the old wizard sympathetically, 
patting Harry shakily on the shoulder. “It happens, young man, it 
happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready 
to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you 
may be able to round off your last answer nicely?” 
“Yes,” said Harry wildly. “I mean . . . no . . . I’ve done — done as 
much as I can, I think. . . .” 
“Very well, very well,” said the old wizard gently. “I shall go and 
collect your examination paper, and I suggest that you go and have a 
nice lie down. . . .” 
I 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 730  
“I’ll do that,” said Harry, nodding vigorously. “Thanks very 
much.” 
He waited for the second when the old man’s heels disappeared 
over the threshold into the Great Hall, then ran up the marble stair-
case and then more staircases toward the hospital wing, hurtling along 
the corridors so fast that the portraits he passed muttered reproaches, 
and burst through the double doors like a hurricane, causing Madam 
Pomfrey, who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Mon-
tague’s open mouth, to shriek in alarm. 
“Potter, what do you think you’re doing?” 
“I need to see Professor McGonagall,” gasped Harry, the breath 
tearing his lungs. “Now . . . It’s urgent. . . .” 
“She’s not here, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey sadly. “She was trans-
ferred to St. Mungo’s this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to 
the chest at her age? It’s a wonder they didn’t kill her.” 
“She’s . . . gone?” said Harry, stunned. 
The bell rang just outside the dormitory, and he heard the usual 
distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors 
above and below him. He remained quite still, looking at Madam 
Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him. 
There was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had 
gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, 
irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly 
present. . . . 
“I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey with 
a kind of fierce approval in her face. “As if one of them could have 
Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight! Cowardice, that’s 
what it was. . . . Despicable cowardice . . . If I wasn’t worried what 
would happen to you students without me, I’d resign in protest. . . .” 
“Yes,” said Harry blankly. 
He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor 
where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside

him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think 
what to do. . . . 
Ron and Hermione, said a voice in his head. 
He was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious 
to their angry protests and shouts. He sprinted back down two floors 
and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying 
toward him. 
“Harry!” said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. “What 
happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?” 
“Where have you been?” demanded Ron. 
“Come with me,” Harry said quickly. “Come on, I’ve got to tell 
you something. . . .” 
He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through door-
ways, and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived, clos-
ing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside 
and leaning against it, facing them. 
“Voldemort’s got Sirius.” 
“What?” 
“How d’you — ?” 
“Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.” 
“But — but where? How?” said Hermione, whose face was white. 
“I dunno how,” said Harry. “But I know exactly where. There’s a 
room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these 
little glass balls, and they’re at the end of row ninety-seven . . . He’s 
trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there. . . . 
He’s torturing him. . . . Says he’ll end by killing him . . .” 
Harry found his voice was shaking, as were his knees. He moved 
over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself. 
“How’re we going to get there?” he asked them. 
There was a moment’s silence. Then Ron said, “G-get there?” 
“Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!” 
Harry said loudly. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 732  
“But — Harry . . .” said Ron weakly. 
“What? What?” said Harry. 
He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as 
though he was asking them something unreasonable. 
“Harry,” said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, “er . . . how 
. . . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without any-
body realizing he was there?” 
“How do I know?” bellowed Harry. “The question is how we’re 
going to get in there!” 
“But . . . Harry, think about this,” said Hermione, taking a step 
toward him, “it’s five o’clock in the afternoon. . . . The Ministry of 
Magic must be full of workers. . . . How would Voldemort and Sirius 
have got in without being seen? Harry . . . they’re probably the two 
most wanted wizards in the world. . . . You think they could get into 
a building full of Aurors undetected?” 
“I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!” 
Harry shouted. “Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always 
been completely empty whenever I’ve been —” 
“You’ve never been there, Harry,” said Hermione quietly. “You’ve 
dreamed about the place, that’s all.” 
“They’re not normal dreams!” Harry shouted in her face, standing 
up and taking a step closer to her in turn. He wanted to shake her. 
“How d’you explain Ron’s dad then, what was all that about, how 
come I knew what had happened to him?” 
“He’s got a point,” said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione. 
“But this is just — just so unlikely!” said Hermione desperately. 
“Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when 
he’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?” 
“Sirius might’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,” said Ron, 
sounding worried. “He’s been desperate to get out of that house for

“But why,” Hermione persisted, “why on earth would Voldemort 
want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?” 
“I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!” Harry yelled at her. 
“Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn’t care about seeing 
hurt —” 
“You know what, I’ve just thought of something,” said Ron in a 
hushed voice. “Sirius’s brother was a Death Eater, wasn’t he? Maybe he 
told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!” 
“Yeah — and that’s why Dumbledore’s been so keen to keep Sirius 
locked up all the time!” said Harry. 
“Look, I’m sorry,” cried Hermione, “but neither of you are making 
sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and 
Sirius are even there —” 
“Hermione, Harry’s seen them!” said Ron, rounding on her. 
“Okay,” she said, looking frightened yet determined, “I’ve just got 
to say this. . . .” 
“What?” 
“You . . . This isn’t a criticism, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I 
mean — don’t you think you’ve got a bit of a — a — saving-people-
thing?” she said. 
He glared at her. “And what’s that supposed to mean, a ‘saving-
people-thing’?” 
“Well . . . you . . .” She looked more apprehensive than ever. “I 
mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tourna-
ment . . . you shouldn’t have . . . I mean, you didn’t need to save that 
little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . .” 
A wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry’s body — how could she 
remind him of that blunder now? 
“. . . I mean, it was really great of you and everything,” said 
Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry’s 
face. “Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do —” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 734  
“That’s funny,” said Harry in a trembling voice, “because I definitely 
remember Ron saying I’d wasted time acting the hero. . . . Is that what 
you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?” 
“No, no, no!” said Hermione, looking aghast. “That’s not what I 
mean at all!” 
“Well, spit out what you’ve got to say, because we’re wasting time 
here!” Harry shouted. 
“I’m trying to say — Voldemort knows you, Harry! He took Ginny 
down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it’s the kind of 
thing he does, he knows you’re the — the sort of person who’d go to 
Sirius’s aid! What if he’s just trying to get you into the Department of 
Myst — ?” 
“Hermione, it doesn’t matter if he’s done it to get me there or 
not — they’ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo’s, there isn’t anyone 
left from the Order at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don’t go, 
Sirius is dead!” 
“But Harry — what if your dream was — was just that, a dream?” 
Harry let out a roar of frustration. Hermione actually stepped back 
from him, looking alarmed. 
“You don’t get it!” Harry shouted at her. “I’m not having night-
mares, I’m not just dreaming! What d’you think all the Occlumency 
was for, why d’you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from 
seeing these things? Because they’re REAL, Hermione — Sirius is 
trapped — I’ve seen him — Voldemort’s got him, and no one else 
knows, and that means we’re the only ones who can save him, and if 
you don’t want to do it, fine, but I’m going, understand? And if I re-
member rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my saving-people-thing 
when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or” — he rounded 
on Ron — “when it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk —” 
“I never said I had a problem!” said Ron heatedly. 
“But Harry, you’ve just said it,” said Hermione fiercely. “Dumble-

dore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if 
you’d done Occlumency properly you’d never have seen this —” 
“IF YOU THINK I’M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I 
HAVEN’T SEEN —” 
“Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learn-
ing to close your mind!” 
“WELL, I EXPECT HE’D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF 
HE KNEW WHAT I’D JUST —” 
The classroom door opened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped 
around. Ginny walked in, looking curious, followed by Luna, who as 
usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally. 
“Hi,” said Ginny uncertainly. “We recognized Harry’s voice — 
what are you yelling about?” 
“Never you mind,” said Harry roughly. 
Ginny raised her eyebrows. 
“There’s no need to take that tone with me,” she said coolly. “I was 
only wondering whether I could help.” 
“Well, you can’t,” said Harry shortly. 
“You’re being rather rude, you know,” said Luna serenely. 
Harry swore and turned away. The very last thing he wanted now 
was a conversation with Luna Lovegood. 
“Wait,” said Hermione suddenly. “Wait . . . Harry, they can help.” 
Harry and Ron looked at her. 
“Listen,” she said urgently, “Harry, we need to establish whether 
Sirius really has left headquarters —” 
“I’ve told you, I saw —” 
“Harry, I’m begging you, please!” said Hermione desperately. 
“Please let’s just check that Sirius isn’t at home before we go charging 
off to London — if we find out he’s not there then I swear I won’t try 
and stop you, I’ll come, I’ll d-do whatever it takes to try and save 
him —” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 736  
“Sirius is being tortured NOW!” shouted Harry. “We haven’t got 
time to waste —” 
“But if this is a trick of V-Voldemort’s — Harry, we’ve got to check, 
we’ve got to —” 
“How?” Harry demanded. “How’re we going to check?” 
“We’ll have to use Umbridge’s fire and see if we can contact him,” 
said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. “We’ll 
draw Umbridge away again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where 
we can use Ginny and Luna.” 
Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny 
said immediately, “Yeah, we’ll do it,” and Luna said, “When you say 
‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman?” 
Nobody answered her. 
“Okay,” Harry said aggressively to Hermione, “Okay, if you can 
think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m go-
ing to the Department of Mysteries right now —” 
“The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly sur-
prised. “But how are you going to get there?” 
Again, Harry ignored her. 
“Right,” said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up 
and down between the desks. “Right . . . well . . . One of us has to go 
and find Umbridge and — and send her off in the wrong direction, 
keep her away from her office. They could tell her — I don’t know — 
that Peeves is up to something awful as usual. . . .” 
“I’ll do it,” said Ron at once. “I’ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the 
Transfiguration department or something, it’s miles away from her of-
fice. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if 
I met him on the way. . . .” 
It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made 
no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department. 
“Okay,” she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace.  
 
OUT  OF  THE  FIRE 
 737  
“Now, we need to keep students away from her office while we force 
entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip her off. . . .” 
“Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said Ginny 
promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s 
let off a load of Garroting Gas.” Hermione looked surprised at the 
readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie. Ginny shrugged 
and said, “Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.” 
“Okay,” said Hermione, “well then, Harry, you and I will be under 
the Invisibility Cloak, and we’ll sneak into the office and you can talk 
to Sirius —” 
“He’s not there, Hermione!” 
“I mean, you can — can check whether Sirius is at home or not 
while I keep watch, I don’t think you should be in there alone, Lee’s 
already proved the window’s a weak spot, sending those nifflers 
through it.” 
Even through his anger and impatience Harry recognized Her-
mione’s offer to accompany him into Umbridge’s office as a sign of 
solidarity and loyalty. 
“I . . . okay, thanks,” he muttered. 
“Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don’t think we’re going to 
be able to bank on more than five minutes,” said Hermione, looking 
relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, “not with Filch 
and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.” 
“Five minutes’ll be enough,” said Harry. “C’mon, let’s go —” 
“Now?” said Hermione, looking shocked. 
“Of course now!” said Harry angrily. “What did you think, we’re 
going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is be-
ing tortured right now!” 
“I — oh all right,” she said desperately. “You go and get the Invisi-
bility Cloak and we’ll meet you at the end of Umbridge’s corridor, 
okay?” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 738  
Harry did not answer, but flung himself out of the room and began 
to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he 
met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they 
were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the com-
mon room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the por-
trait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market 
butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the In-
visibility Cloak and Sirius’s knife secure in his bag, before they noticed 
he had left them. 
“Harry, d’you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle 
reckons he could sell us some firewhisky. . . .” 
But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a 
couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, 
Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were huddled together at the end 
of Umbridge’s corridor. 
“Got it,” he panted. “Ready to go, then?” 
“All right,” whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years 
passed them. “So Ron — you go and head Umbridge off. . . . Ginny, 
Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . . Harry 
and I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear. . . .” 
Ron strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the 
passage. Meanwhile, Ginny’s equally vivid head bobbed between the 
jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by 
Luna’s blonde one. 
“Get over here,” muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry’s wrist and 
pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval 
wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. “Are — are you sure 
you’re okay, Harry? You’re still very pale. . . .” 
“I’m fine,” he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out 
of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he 
thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow. It had hurt much 
worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery. . . . 
OUT  OF  THE  FIRE 
 739  
“Here,” he said. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them 
and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the 
bust in front of them. 
“You can’t come down here!” Ginny was calling to the crowd. “No, 
sorry, you’re going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase, 
someone’s let off Garroting Gas just along here —” 
They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, “I can’t 
see no gas . . .” 
“That’s because it’s colorless,” said Ginny in a convincingly exas-
perated voice, “but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we’ll 
have your body as proof for the next idiot who didn’t believe us. . . .” 
Slowly the crowd thinned. The news about the Garroting Gas 
seemed to have spread — people were not coming this way anymore. 
When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said qui-
etly, “I think that’s as good as we’re going to get, Harry — come on, 
let’s do it.” 
Together they moved forward, covered by the cloak. Luna was 
standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they 
passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, “Good one . . . don’t forget the 
signal . . .” 
“What’s the signal?” muttered Harry, as they approached Urn-
bridge’s door. 
“A loud chorus of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ if they see Umbridge com-
ing,” replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in 
the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open, and they en-
tered the office. 
The garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine 
warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and empty as 
last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief. 
“I thought she might have added extra security after the second 
niffler. . . .” 
They pulled off the cloak. Hermione hurried over to the window 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 740  
and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand 
out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder, 
and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into 
life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing 
fire, and cried, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” 
His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground 
ride though his knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office 
floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when 
the spinning stopped, he opened them to find himself looking out 
upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place. 
There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not pre-
pared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst 
through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room. 
“Sirius?” he shouted. “Sirius, are you there?” 
His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except 
a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire. 
“Who’s there?” he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse. 
Kreacher the house-elf came creeping into view. He looked highly 
delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sus-
tained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged. 
“It’s the Potter boy’s head in the fire,” Kreacher informed the empty 
kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. “What 
has he come for, Kreacher wonders?” 
“Where’s Sirius, Kreacher?” Harry demanded. 
The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle. “Master has gone out, Harry 
Potter.” 
“Where’s he gone? Where’s he gone, Kreacher?” 
Kreacher merely cackled. 
“I’m warning you!” said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflict-
ing punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position. 
“What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them here?” 
 
OUT  OF  THE  FIRE 
 741  
“Nobody here but Kreacher!” said the elf gleefully, and turning 
away from Harry he began to walk slowly toward the door at the end 
of the kitchen. “Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his 
Mistress now, yes, he hasn’t had a chance in a long time, Kreacher’s 
Master has been keeping him away from her —” 
“Where has Sirius gone?” Harry yelled after the elf. “Kreacher, has 
he gone to the Department of Mysteries?” 
Kreacher stopped in his tracks. Harry could just make out the back 
of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him. 
“Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,” said the elf 
quietly. 
“But you know!” shouted Harry. “Don’t you? You know where 
he is!” 
There was a moment’s silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle 
yet. “Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!” 
he said gleefully. “Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again!” 
And he scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the 
hall. 
“You — !” 
But before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great 
pain at the top of his head. He inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, 
found himself being dragged backward through the flames until, with 
a horrible abruptness, he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of 
Professor Umbridge, who had dragged him backward out of the fire 
by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as 
though she was going to slit his throat. 
“You think,” she whispered, bending Harry’s neck back even far-
ther, so that he was looking up at the ceiling above him, “that after 
two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature 
enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells 
placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 742  
boy. Take his wand,” she barked at someone he could not see, and he 
felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the 
wand. “Hers too . . .” 
Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione 
had just had her wand wrested from her as well. 
“I want to know why you are in my office,” said Umbridge, shak-
ing the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered. 
“I was — trying to get my Firebolt!” Harry croaked. 
“Liar.” She shook his head again. “Your Firebolt is under strict 
guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your 
head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?” 
“No one —” said Harry, trying to pull away from her. He felt sev-
eral hairs part company with his scalp. 
“Liar!” shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her, and he 
slammed into the desk. Now he could see Hermione pinioned against 
the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the win-
dowsill, smirking as he threw Harry’s wand into the air one-handed 
and then caught it again. 
There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins 
entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna, and — to Harry’s bewil-
derment — Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe 
and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had 
been gagged. 
“Got ’em all,” said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into 
the room. “That one.” he poked a thick finger at Neville, “tried to stop 
me taking her,” he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins 
of the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him along too.” 
“Good, good,” said Umbridge, watching Ginny’s struggles. “Well, 
it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, 
doesn’t it?” 
Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her  
 
OUT  OF  THE  FIRE 
 743  
wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered arm-
chair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed. 
“So, Potter,” she said. “You stationed lookouts around my office 
and you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed 
even louder, “to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the 
Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was 
busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr. 
Filch having just informed me so. 
“Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it 
Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Min-
erva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone. . . .” 
Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad 
laughed some more at that. Harry found he was so full of rage and ha-
tred he was shaking. 
“It’s none of your business who I talk to,” he snarled. 
Umbridge’s slack face seemed to tighten. 
“Very well,” she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice. 
“Very well, Mr. Potter . . . I offered you the chance to tell me freely. 
You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco — fetch 
Professor Snape.” 
Malfoy stowed Harry’s wand inside his robes and left the room 
smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realized some-
thing; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it. He 
had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could 
help him save Sirius, were gone — but he had been wrong. There 
was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts — 
Snape. 
There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scuf-
flings resultant from the Slytherins’ efforts to keep Ron and the others 
under control. Ron’s lip was bleeding onto Umbridge’s carpet as he 
struggled against Warrington’s half nelson. Ginny was still trying to

 744  
stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms 
in a tight grip. Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face 
while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, and Hermione was attempting vainly 
to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her. Luna, however, stood limply by 
the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though 
rather bored by the proceedings. 
Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely. 
He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were 
heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the 
room, holding open the door for Snape. 
“You wanted to see me, Headmistress?” said Snape, looking around 
at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete 
indifference. 
“Ah, Professor Snape,” said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing 
up again. “Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as 
you can, please.” 
“You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,” he said, observing 
her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair. “Surely you did 
not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.” 
Umbridge flushed. 
“You can make some more, can’t you?” she said, her voice becom-
ing more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious. 
“Certainly,” said Snape, his lip curling. “It takes a full moon cycle 
to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month.” 
“A month?” squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly. “A month? 
But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter using my 
fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!” 
“Really?” said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he 
looked around at Harry. “Well, it doesn’t surprise me. Potter has never 
shown much inclination to follow school rules.” 
His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry’s, who met his gaze un- 
 
OUT  OF  THE  FIRE 
 745  
flinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream, 
willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand . . . 
“I wish to interrogate him!” shouted Umbridge angrily, and Snape 
looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face. “I 
wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me 
the truth!” 
“I have already told you,” said Snape smoothly, “that I have no fur-
ther stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter — and I 
assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did — 
I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast 
to give the victim much time for truth-telling. . . .” 
Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to commu-
nicate without words. 
Voldemort’s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought des-
perately. Voldemort’s got Sirius — 
“You are on probation!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape 
looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. “You are being delib-
erately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most 
highly of you! Now get out of my office!” 
Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his 
last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking 
out of the door. 
“He’s got Padfoot!” he shouted. “He’s got Padfoot at the place 
where it’s hidden!” 
Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge’s door handle. 
“Padfoot?” cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry 
to Snape. “What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he 
mean, Snape?” 
Snape looked around at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry 
could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare 
speak more plainly in front of Umbridge. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-TWO 
 746  
“I have no idea,” said Snape coldly. “Potter, when I want nonsense 
shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, 
loosen your hold a little, if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of 
tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your 
reference if ever you apply for a job.” 
He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state 
of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He 
looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her 
chest was heaving with rage and frustration. 
“Very well,” she said, and she pulled out her wand. “Very well . . . 
I am left with no alternative. . . . This is more than a matter of school 
discipline. . . . This is an issue of Ministry security. . . . Yes . . . 
yes . . .” 
She seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting 
her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her 
wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily. Harry felt horri-
bly powerless without his own wand as he watched her. 
“You are forcing me, Potter. . . . I do not want to,” said Umbridge, 
still moving restlessly on the spot, “but sometimes circumstances jus-
tify the use . . . I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no 
choice. . . .” 
Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face. 
“The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,” said Um-
bridge quietly. 
“No!” shrieked Hermione. “Professor Umbridge — it’s illegal” — 
but Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look 
on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand. 
“The Minister wouldn’t want you to break the law, Professor Um-
bridge!” cried Hermione. 
“What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” said Umbridge, 
who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different  
 
OUT  OF  THE  FIRE 
 747  
parts of Harry’s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would 
hurt the most. “He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last 
summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all 
the same. . . .” 
“It was you?” gasped Harry. “You sent the dementors after me?” 
“Somebody had to act,” breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to 
rest pointing directly at Harry’s forehead. “They were all bleating 
about silencing you somehow — discrediting you — but I was the 
one who actually did something about it. . . . Only you wriggled out 
of that one, didn’t you, Potter? Not today, though, not now . . .” 
And taking a deep breath, she cried, “Cruc —” 
“NO!” shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Milli-
cent Bulstrode. “No — Harry — Harry, we’ll have to tell her!” 
“No way!” yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he could 
see. 
“We’ll have to, Harry, she’ll force it out of you anyway, what’s . . . 
what’s the point. . . ?” 
And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bul-
strode’s robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall 
immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted. 
“Well, well, well!” said Umbridge, looking triumphant. “Little 
Miss Question-All is going to give us some answers! Come on then, 
girl, come on!” 
“Er — my — nee — no!” shouted Ron through his gag. 
Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her 
before; Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her too. But 
Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing 
desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear. . . . 
“I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said Hermione. “But — I can’t stand 
it —” 
“That’s right, that’s right, girl!” said Umbridge, seizing Hermione

by the shoulders, thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and 
leaning over her. “Now then . . . with whom was Potter communicat-
ing just now?” 
“Well,” gulped Hermione into her hands, “well, he was trying to 
speak to Professor Dumbledore. . . .” 
Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her 
Slytherin captor’s toes; even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortu-
nately, the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too 
exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs. 
“Dumbledore?” said Umbridge eagerly. “You know where Dumb-
ledore is, then?” 
“Well . . . no!” sobbed Hermione. “We’ve tried the Leaky Caul-
dron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog’s 
Head —” 
“Idiot girl, Dumbledore won’t be sitting in a pub when the whole 
Ministry’s looking for him!” shouted Umbridge, disappointment 
etched in every sagging line of her face. 
“But — but we needed to tell him something important!” wailed 
Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry 
knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears. 
“Yes?” said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement. 
“What was it you wanted to tell him?” 
“We . . . we wanted to tell him it’s r-ready!” choked Hermione. 
“What’s ready?” demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed 
Hermione’s shoulders again and shook her slightly. “What’s ready, 
girl?” 
“The . . . the weapon,” said Hermione. 
“Weapon? Weapon?” said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop 
with excitement. “You have been developing some method of resis-
tance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor 
Dumbledore’s orders, of course?”

 749  
“Y-y-yes,” gasped Hermione. “But he had to leave before it was fin-
ished and n-n-now we’ve finished it for him, and we c-c-can’t find him 
t-t-to tell him!” 
“What kind of weapon is it?” said Umbridge harshly, her stubby 
hands still tight on Hermione’s shoulders. 
“We don’t r-r-really understand it,” said Hermione, sniffing loudly. 
“We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to 
do . . .” 
Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant. 
“Lead me to the weapon,” she said. 
“I’m not showing . . . them,” said Hermione shrilly, looking around 
at the Slytherins through her fingers. 
“It is not for you to set conditions,” said Professor Umbridge 
harshly. 
“Fine,” said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again, “fine 
. . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you’d in-
vite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th-that would serve 
you right — oh, I’d love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was, 
and how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them they’ll be able 
to s-sort you out!” 
These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge. She glanced 
swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging 
eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the 
look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face. 
Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment and 
then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice. “All 
right, dear, let’s make it just you and me . . . and we’ll take Potter too, 
shall we? Get up, now —” 
“Professor,” said Malfoy eagerly, “Professor Umbridge, I think 
some of the squad should come with you to look after —” 
“I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think

I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?” asked Umbridge 
sharply. “In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is 
something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until 
I return and make sure none of these” — she gestured around at Ron, 
Ginny, Neville, and Luna — “escape.” 
“All right,” said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed. 
“And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,” said Um-
bridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand. “Lead

arry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even 
whether she had a plan. He walked half a pace behind her as 
they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge’s office, knowing it 
would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they 
were going. He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was 
walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged 
breathing. 
Hermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall. The 
din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out 
of the double doors to the Great Hall. It seemed incredible to Harry 
that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, cele-
brating the end of exams, not a care in the world. . . . 
Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the 
stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling toward the 
tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched 
purposefully across the grass, Umbridge jogging to keep up. Their 
long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.

“It’s hidden in Hagrid’s hut, is it?” said Umbridge eagerly in Harry’s 
ear. 
“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly. “Hagrid might have set 
it off accidentally.” 
“Yes,” said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. 
“Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf. . . .” 
She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize her 
by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening 
air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Volde-
mort had moved in for the kill. . . . 
“Then . . . where is it?” asked Umbridge, with a hint of uncertainty 
in her voice as Hermione continued to stride toward the forest. 
“In there, of course,” said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees. 
“It had to be somewhere that students weren’t going to find it acci-
dentally, didn’t it?” 
“Of course,” said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehen-
sive now. “Of course . . . very well, then . . . you two stay ahead of 
me.” 
“Can we have your wand, then, if we’re going first?” Harry asked 
her. 
“No, I don’t think so, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge sweetly, poking 
him in the back with it. “The Ministry places a rather higher value on 
my life than yours, I’m afraid.” 
As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch 
Hermione’s eye; walking into the forest without wands seemed to him 
to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening. 
She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and 
plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, 
with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up. 
“Is it very far in?” Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble. 
“Oh yes,” said Hermione. “Yes, it’s well hidden.” 
Harry’s misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path 
FIGHT  AND  FLIGHT

they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he had followed three 
years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been 
with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger 
lay at the end of it. 
“Er — are you sure this is the right way?” he asked her pointedly. 
“Oh yes,” she said in a steely voice, crashing through the under-
growth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of 
noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither 
of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on, 
calling loudly over her shoulder, “It’s a bit further in!” 
“Hermione, keep your voice down,” Harry muttered, hurrying to 
catch up with her. “Anything could be listening in here —” 
“I want us heard,” she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged nois-
ily after them. “You’ll see. . . .” 
They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once 
again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all 
light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest, one of be-
ing watched by unseen eyes. . . . 
“How much further?” demanded Umbridge angrily from behind 
him. 
“Not far now!” shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, 
dank clearing. “Just a little bit —” 
An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in 
the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of 
hooves. Harry could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a 
little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield — 
He wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty centaurs 
were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at 
Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center 
of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror. 
Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant 
smile. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE 
 754  
“Who are you?” said a voice. 
Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian 
was walking toward them out of the circle; his bow, like the others’, 
was raised. On Harry’s right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her 
wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur. 
“I asked you who are you, human,” said Magorian roughly. 
“I am Dolores Umbridge!” said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terri-
fied voice. “Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Head-
mistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!” 
“You are from the Ministry of Magic?” said Magorian, as many of 
the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly. 
“That’s right!” said Umbridge in an even higher voice. “So be very 
careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation 
and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as 
yourselves on a human —” 
“What did you call us?” shouted a wild-looking black centaur, 
whom Harry recognized as Bane. There was a great deal of angry mut-
tering and tightening of bowstrings around them. 
“Don’t call them that!” Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did 
not appear to have heard her. Still pointing her shaking wand at 
Magorian, she continued, “Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any at-
tack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelli-
gence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions —’ ” 
“ ‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and sev-
eral others roared with rage and pawed the ground. “We consider that 
a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your 
own —” 
“What are you doing in our forest?” bellowed the hard-faced gray 
centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into 
the forest. “Why are you here?” 
“Your forest?” said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but 
also, it seemed, with indignation. “I would remind you that you live 
FIGHT  AND  FLIGHT 
 755  
here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of 
land —” 
An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair 
in passing. She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over 
her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and oth-
ers laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter 
echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing 
hooves was extremely unnerving. 
“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane. 
“Filthy half-breeds!” she screamed, her hands still tight over her 
head. “Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!” 
“Be quiet!” shouted Hermione, but it was too late — Umbridge 
pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, “Incarcerous!” 
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves 
tightly around the centaur’s torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry 
of rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while 
the other centaurs charged. 
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground. Facedown 
on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered 
around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing 
and screaming with rage. 
“Nooooo!” he heard Umbridge shriek. “Noooooo . . . I am Senior 
Undersecretary . . . you cannot . . . unhand me, you animals . . . 
nooooo!” 
He saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun 
one of them — then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few 
inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by 
Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. 
Her wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harry’s heart leapt, if 
he could just reach it — 
But as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur’s hoof descended 
upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE 
 756  
“Now!” roared a voice in Harry’s ear and a thick hairy arm de-
scended from thin air and dragged him upright; Hermione too had 
been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs and 
heads of the centaurs Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through 
the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and 
fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves 
surrounding them. 
“And these?” said the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione. 
“They are young,” said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry. 
“We do not attack foals.” 
“They brought her here, Ronan,” replied the centaur who had such 
a firm grip on Harry. “And they are not so young. . . . He is nearing 
manhood, this one. . . .” 
He shook Harry by the neck of his robes. 
“Please,” said Hermione breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, we 
don’t think like her, we aren’t Ministry of Magic employees! We only 
came in here because we hoped you’d drive her off for us —” 
Harry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur 
holding Hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this. 
The gray centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furi-
ously, and bellowed, “You see, Ronan? They already have the arro-
gance of their kind! So we were to do your dirty work, were we, 
human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies 
like obedient hounds?” 
“No!” said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. “Please — I didn’t 
mean that! I just hoped you’d be able to — to help us —” 
But she seemed to be going from bad to worse. 
“We do not help humans!” snarled the centaur holding Harry, 
tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry’s 
feet left the ground momentarily. “We are a race apart and proud to 
be so. . . . We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we 
did your bidding!” 
FIGHT  AND  FLIGHT 
 757  
“We’re not going to say anything like that!” Harry shouted. “We 
know you didn’t do anything because we wanted you to —” 
But nobody seemed to be listening to him. A bearded centaur to-
ward the back of the crowd shouted, “They came here unasked, they 
must pay the consequences!” 
A roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur 
shouted, “They can join the woman!” 
“You said you didn’t hurt the innocent!” shouted Hermione, real 
tears sliding down her face now. “We haven’t done anything to hurt 
you, we haven’t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to 
school, please let us go back —” 
“We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!” shouted the 
gray centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows. 
“Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an ancient peo-
ple who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recog-
nize your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are —” 
But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment 
there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all 
of them — Harry, Hermione, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the 
clearing — looked around. Harry’s centaur let him fall to the ground 
again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione 
had been dropped too, and Harry hurried toward her as two thick tree 
trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant 
appeared in the gap. 
The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind. The clearing 
was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing 
upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from 
just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp’s lopsided mouth 
was gaping stupidly. They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glim-
mering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he 
squinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from 
both ankles. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE 
 758  
He opened his mouth even wider. 
“Hagger.” 
Harry did not know what “hagger” meant, or what language it was 
from, nor did he much care — he was watching Grawp’s feet, which 
were almost as long as Harry’s whole body. Hermione gripped his arm 
tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose 
huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer 
amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped. 
“Hagger!” he said again, more insistently. 
“Get away from here, giant!” called Magorian. “You are not wel-
come among us!” 
These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp. 
He stooped a little (the centaurs’ arms tensed on their bows) and then 
bellowed, “HAGGER!” 
A few of the centaurs looked worried now. Hermione, however, 
gave a gasp. 
“Harry!” she whispered. “I think he’s trying to say ‘Hagrid’!” 
At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two 
humans in a sea of centaurs. He lowered his head another foot or so, 
staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as 
Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling 
voice, “Hermy.” 
“Goodness,” said Hermione, gripping Harry’s arm so tightly it was 
growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, “he — 
he remembered!” 
“HERMY!” roared Grawp. “WHERE HAGGER?” 
“I don’t know!” squealed Hermione, terrified. “I’m sorry, Grawp, I 
don’t know!” 
“GRAWP WANT HAGGER!” 
One of the giant’s massive hands swooped down upon them — 
Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backward and fell over. 
Wandless, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite, or whatever else 
FIGHT  AND  FLIGHT 
 759  
it took as the hand flew toward him and knocked a snow-white cen-
taur off his legs. 
It was what the centaurs had been waiting for — Grawp’s out-
stretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows went soar-
ing through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing 
him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing his 
face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forc-
ing the heads in still deeper. 
He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scat-
tered out of the way. Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered 
Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as 
fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there they looked 
back — Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran all 
down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away 
through the trees on the other side of the clearing. As Harry and 
Hermione watched, Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged af-
ter them, smashing more trees aside as he went. 
“Oh no,” said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way. 
“Oh, that was horrible. And he might kill them all. . . .” 
“I’m not that fussed, to be honest,” said Harry bitterly. 
The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant 
were growing fainter and fainter. As Harry listened to them his scar 
gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him. 
They had wasted so much time — they were even further from res-
cuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision. Not only 
had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the mid-
dle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever. 
“Smart plan,” he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury. 
“Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?” 
“We need to get back up to the castle,” said Hermione faintly. 
“By the time we’ve done that, Sirius’ll probably be dead!” said 
Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE 
 760  
chattering overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flex-
ing its long twiglike fingers at him. 
“Well, we can’t do anything without wands,” said Hermione hope-
lessly, dragging herself up again. “Anyway, Harry, how exactly were 
you planning to get all the way to London?” 
“Yeah, we were just wondering that,” said a familiar voice from be-
hind her. 
Harry and Hermione moved instinctively together, peering through 
the trees, as Ron came into sight, with Ginny, Neville, and Luna hur-
rying along behind him. All of them looked a little the worse for 
wear — there were several long scratches running the length of 
Ginny’s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling above Neville’s right 
eye, Ron’s lip was bleeding worse than ever — but all were looking 
rather pleased with themselves. 
“So,” said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding 
out Harry’s wand, “had any ideas?” 
“How did you get away?” asked Harry in amazement, taking his 
wand from Ron. 
“Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a re-
ally nice little Impediment Jinx,” said Ron airily, now handing back 
Hermione’s wand too. “But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy — Bat-
Bogey Hex — it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great 
flapping things. Anyway, we saw you heading into the forest out of the 
window and followed. What’ve you done with Umbridge?” 
“She got carried away,” said Harry. “By a herd of centaurs.” 
“And they left you behind?” asked Ginny, looking astonished. 
“No, they got chased off by Grawp,” said Harry. 
“Who’s Grawp?” Luna asked interestedly. 
“Hagrid’s little brother,” said Ron promptly. “Anyway, never mind 
that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-
Who got Sirius or — ?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, “and I’m 
FIGHT  AND  FLIGHT 
 761  
sure Sirius is still alive, but I can’t see how we’re going to get there to 
help him.” 
They all fell silent, looking rather scared. The problem facing them 
seemed insurmountable. 
“Well, we’ll have to fly, won’t we?” said Luna in the closest thing to 
a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use. 
“Okay,” said Harry irritably, rounding on her, “first of all, ‘we’ 
aren’t doing anything if you’re including yourself in that, and second 
of all, Ron’s the only one with a broomstick that isn’t being guarded by 
a security troll, so —” 
“I’ve got a broom!” said Ginny. 
“Yeah, but you’re not coming,” said Ron angrily. 
“Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!” 
said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George 
was suddenly striking. 
“You’re too —” Harry began. 
“I’m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-
Who over the Sorcerer’s Stone,” she said fiercely, “and it’s because of 
me Malfoy’s stuck back in Umbridge’s office with giant flying bogeys 
attacking him —” 
“Yeah, but —” 
“We were all in the D.A. together,” said Neville quietly. “It was all 
supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn’t it? And this is 
the first chance we’ve had to do something real — or was that all just 
a game or something?” 
“No — of course it wasn’t —” said Harry impatiently. 
“Then we should come too,” said Neville simply. “We want to help.” 
“That’s right,” said Luna, smiling happily. 
Harry’s eyes met Ron’s. He knew that Ron was thinking exactly 
what he was: If he could have chosen any members of the D.A. in ad-
dition to himself, Ron, and Hermione to join him in the attempt to 
rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-THREE 
 762  
“Well, it doesn’t matter anyway,” said Harry frustratedly, “because 
we still don’t know how to get there —” 
“I thought we’d settled that?” said Luna maddeningly. “We’re 
flying!” 
“Look,” said Ron, barely containing his anger, “you might be able 
to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can’t sprout wings when-
ever we —” 
“There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks,” said Luna 
serenely. 
“I s’pose we’re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or 
whatever it is?” Ron demanded. 
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can’t fly,” said Luna in a dignified 
voice, “but they can, and Hagrid says they’re very good at finding 
places their riders are looking for.” 
Harry whirled around. Standing between two trees, their white 
eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered con-
versation as though they understood every word. 
“Yes!” he whispered, moving toward them. They tossed their reptil-
ian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out 
his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one’s shining neck. How could 
he ever have thought them ugly? 
“Is it those mad horse things?” said Ron uncertainly, staring at a 
point slightly to the left of the thestral Harry was patting. “Those ones 
you can’t see unless you’ve watched someone snuff it?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry. 
“How many?” 
“Just two.” 
“Well, we need three,” said Hermione, who was still looking a lit-
tle shaken, but determined just the same. 
“Four, Hermione,” said Ginny, scowling. 
“I think there are six of us, actually,” said Luna calmly, counting. 
“Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go!” said Harry angrily. “Look, you 
FIGHT  AND  FLIGHT 
 763  
three” — he pointed at Neville, Ginny, and Luna — “you’re not in-
volved in this, you’re not —” 
They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, 
twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have 
time to argue. 
“Okay, fine, it’s your choice,” he said curtly. “But unless we can find 
more thestrals you’re not going to be able —” 
“Oh, more of them will come,” said Ginny confidently, who like 
Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the 
impression that she was looking at the horses. 
“What makes you think that?” 
“Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both 
covered in blood,” she said coolly, “and we know Hagrid lures thes-
trals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the 
first place. . . .” 
Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down 
to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with 
Grawp’s blood. 
“Okay, then,” he said, a bright idea occurring. “Ron and I will take 
these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three 
and she’ll attract more thestrals —” 
“I’m not staying behind!” said Hermione furiously. 
“There’s no need,” said Luna, smiling. “Look, here come more 
now. . . . You two must really smell. . . .” 
Harry turned. No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking 
their way through the trees now, their great leathery wings folded 
tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He 
had no excuse now. . . . 
“All right,” he said angrily, “pick one and get on, then.”

arry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest 
thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby, and scrambled 
clumsily onto the horse’s silken back. It did not object, but twisted its 
head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking 
of his robes. 
He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing 
joints that made him feel more secure and looked around at the oth-
ers. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and 
was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature’s back. 
Luna was already in place, sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as 
though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, however, 
were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring. 
“What?” he said. 
“How’re we supposed to get on?” said Ron faintly. “When we can’t 
see the things?” 
“Oh it’s easy,” said Luna, sliding obligingly from her thestral and 
marching over to him, Hermione, and Ginny. “Come here. . . .”

She pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and 
one by one managed to help them onto the backs of their mounts. All 
three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into the 
horses’ manes and told them to grip tightly before getting back onto 
her own steed. 
“This is mad,” Ron said faintly, moving his free hand gingerly up 
and down his horse’s neck. “Mad . . . if I could just see it —” 
“You’d better hope it stays invisible,” said Harry darkly. “We all 
ready, then?” 
They all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath 
their robes. 
“Okay . . .” 
He looked down at the back of his thestral’s glossy black head and 
swallowed. “Ministry of Magic, visitors’ entrance, London, then,” he 
said uncertainly. “Er . . . if you know . . . where to go . . .” 
For a moment his thestral did nothing at all. Then, with a sweep-
ing movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side ex-
tended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast 
and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly 
around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump. He 
closed his eyes and put his face down into the horse’s silky mane as 
they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out 
into a bloodred sunset. 
Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: The thestral 
streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating. The cooling air 
was slapping Harry’s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, 
he looked around and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, 
each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to 
protect themselves from its slipstream. 
They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogs-
meade. Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. In the  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 766  
falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed 
over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was 
beetling its way home through the hills. . . . 
“This is bizarre!” Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind 
him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this 
height with no visible means of support. . . . 
Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with 
tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that 
gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very 
fast they were traveling. Harry’s arms were wrapped tightly around his 
horse’s neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had 
elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries 
floor? How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort? All 
Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort 
wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would 
cause him to feel Voldemort’s jubilation or fury course through his 
own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr. 
Weasley was attacked. . . . 
On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry’s face felt stiff 
and cold, his legs numb from gripping the thestral’s sides so tightly, 
but he did not dare shift positions lest he slip. . . . He was deaf from 
the thundering in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the 
rush of cold night air. He had lost all sense of how far they had come; 
all his faith was in the beast below him, still streaking purposefully 
through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onward. . . . 
If they were too late . . . 
He’s still alive, he’s still fighting, I can feel it. . . . 
If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack . . . 
I’d know. . . . 
Harry’s stomach gave a jolt. The thestral’s head was suddenly point-
ing toward the ground and he had actually slid forward a few inches 
along its neck. They were descending at last. . . . He heard one of the 
THE  DEPARTMENT 
OF  MYSTERIES 
 767  
girls shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see 
no sign of a falling body. . . . Presumably they had received a shock 
from the change of position, just as he had. . . . 
And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on 
all sides. They could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights 
like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows. 
Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling toward the pavement. 
Harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength, 
braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as 
lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from his back, looking around at 
the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from 
the vandalized telephone box, both drained of color in the flat orange 
glare of the streetlights. 
Ron landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thes-
tral onto the pavement. 
“Never again,” he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to 
stride away from his thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its 
hindquarters and almost fell over again. “Never, ever again . . . that 
was the worst —” 
Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him. Both 
slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with 
similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground. Neville 
jumped down, shaking, but Luna dismounted smoothly. 
“Where do we go from here, then?” she asked Harry in a politely 
interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip. 
“Over here,” he said. He gave his thestral a quick, grateful pat, then 
led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the 
door. “Come on!” he urged the others as they hesitated. 
Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville, and 
Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back 
at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the 
dumpster, then forced himself into the box after Luna. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 768  
“Whoever’s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!” he said. 
Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial. As it whirred 
back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box, “Wel-
come to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.” 
“Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,” Harry said very 
quickly, “Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood . . . 
We’re here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!” 
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitors, please take the 
badges and attach them to the front of your robes.” 
Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned 
coins usually appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them 
mutely to Harry over Ginny’s head; he glanced at the topmost one. 
 
HARRY POTTER 
rescue mission 
 
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and 
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is lo-
cated at the far end of the Atrium.” 
“Fine!” Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. “Now can 
we move?” 
The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose 
up past the glass windows of the telephone box. The scavenging thes-
trals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over their heads, and 
with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Min-
istry of Magic. 
A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up 
their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he 
could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see 
whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed 
to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by 
day. There were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the 
THE  DEPARTMENT 
OF  MYSTERIES 
 769  
walls, but he saw as the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbols 
continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling. 
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,” said the 
woman’s voice. 
The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of 
it, followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was 
the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the 
wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the 
tip of the goblin’s hat, and the house-elf’s ears continued to gush into 
the surrounding pool. 
“Come on,” said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off 
down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk 
where the security man who had weighed Harry’s wand had sat and 
which was now deserted. 
Harry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure 
that their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding 
increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He 
pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost 
immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clank-
ing, and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button, 
the grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling 
and rattling. Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the 
day that he had come with Mr. Weasley — he was sure that the din 
would raise every security person within the building, yet when the 
lift halted, the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” and 
the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where 
nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of 
air from the lift. 
Harry turned toward the plain black door. After months and 
months of dreaming about it, he was here at last. . . . 
“Let’s go,” he whispered, and he led the way down the corridor, 
Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 770  
“Okay, listen,” said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the 
door. “Maybe . . . maybe a couple of people should stay here as a — 
as a lookout, and —” 
“And how’re we going to let you know something’s coming?” asked 
Ginny, her eyebrows raised. “You could be miles away.” 
“We’re coming with you, Harry,” said Neville. 
“Let’s get on with it,” said Ron firmly. 
Harry still did not want to take them all with him, but it seemed he 
had no choice. He turned to face the door and walked forward. Just as 
it had in his dream, it swung open and he marched forward, leading 
the others over the threshold. 
They were standing in a large, circular room. Everything in here 
was black including the floor and ceiling — identical, unmarked, 
handle-less black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls, 
interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue, their 
cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it 
looked as though there was dark water underfoot. 
“Someone shut the door,” Harry muttered. 
He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it. 
Without the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind 
them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they 
could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and 
their ghostly reflections in the floor below. 
In his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this 
room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on. 
But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he was gazing ahead 
at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one, 
there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move side-
ways. The circular wall was rotating. 
Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm as though frightened the floor 
might move too, but it did not. For a few seconds the blue flames 
around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped 
THE  DEPARTMENT 
OF  MYSTERIES 
 771  
around and then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling 
stopped and everything became stationary once again. 
Harry’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could 
see. 
“What was that about?” whispered Ron fearfully. 
“I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from,” 
said Ginny in a hushed voice. 
Harry realized at once that she was right: He could no sooner have 
picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-
black floor. Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to pro-
ceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them. 
“How’re we going to get back out?” said Neville uncomfortably. 
“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Harry forcefully, blinking to 
try and erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand 
tighter than ever. “We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —” 
“Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but 
Harry had never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as 
quiet as possible for the time being. 
“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked. 
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went 
through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark 
room — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into 
a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors,” he said 
hastily. “I’ll know the right way when I see it. C’mon.” 
He marched straight at the door now facing him, the others follow-
ing close behind him, set his left hand against its cool, shining surface, 
raised his wand, ready to strike the moment it opened, and pushed. It 
swung open easily. 
After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on 
golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rec-
tangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, 
shimmering lights such as Harry had seen in his dreams. The place 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 772  
was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the 
room, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all 
of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects 
that were drifting around lazily in the liquid. 
“What’re those things?” whispered Ron. 
“Dunno,” said Harry. 
“Are they fish?” breathed Ginny. 
“Aquavirius maggots!” said Luna excitedly. “Dad said the Ministry 
were breeding —” 
“No,” said Hermione. She sounded odd. She moved forward to 
look through the side of the tank. “They’re brains.” 
“Brains?” 
“Yes . . . I wonder what they’re doing with them?” 
Harry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mis-
take now that he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily they 
drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking 
something like slimy cauliflowers. 
“Let’s get out of here,” said Harry. “This isn’t right, we need to try 
another door —” 
“There are doors here too,” said Ron, pointing around the walls. 
Harry’s heart sank; how big was this place? 
“In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,” 
he said. “I think we should go back and try from there.” 
So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly 
shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry’s eyes instead 
of the blue candle flames. 
“Wait!” said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of 
the brain room behind them. “Flagrate!” 
She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the 
door. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there 
was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very 
fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue, 
THE  DEPARTMENT 
OF  MYSTERIES 
 773  
and when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing 
the door they had already tried. 
“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Okay, let’s try this one —” 
Again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open, 
his wand still raised, the others at his heels. 
This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the 
center of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet be-
low them. They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to 
be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep 
steps like an amphitheater, or the courtroom in which Harry had been 
tried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a chained chair, however, there was 
a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor, and upon this dais 
stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling 
that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing. Unsupported by 
any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black cur-
tain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surround-
ing air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched. 
“Who’s there?” said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below. 
There was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway. 
“Careful!” whispered Hermione. 
Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the 
stone bottom of the sunken pit. His footsteps echoed loudly as he 
walked slowly toward the dais. The pointed archway looked much 
taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down 
on it from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had 
just passed through it. 
“Sirius?” Harry spoke again, but much more quietly now that he 
was nearer. 
He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right 
behind the veil on the other side of the archway. Gripping his wand 
very tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there. All 
that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 774  
“Let’s go,” called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. “This 
isn’t right, Harry, come on, let’s go. . . .” 
She sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room 
where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of 
beauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling veil intrigued 
him; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk 
through it. 
“Harry, let’s go, okay?” said Hermione more forcefully. 
“Okay,” he said, but he did not move. He had just heard some-
thing. There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from 
the other side of the veil. 
“What are you saying?” he said very loudly, so that the words 
echoed all around the surrounding stone benches. 
“Nobody’s talking, Harry!” said Hermione, now moving over to 
him. 
“Someone’s whispering behind there,” he said, moving out of her 
reach and continuing to frown at the veil. “Is that you, Ron?” 
“I’m here, mate,” said Ron, appearing around the side of the arch-
way. 
“Can’t anyone else hear it?” Harry demanded, for the whispering 
and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put 
it there, he found his foot was on the dais. 
“I can hear them too,” breathed Luna, joining them around the 
side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil. “There are people 
in there!” 
“What do you mean, ‘in there’?” demanded Hermione, jumping 
down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the oc-
casion warranted. “There isn’t any ‘in there,’ it’s just an archway, there’s 
no room for anybody to be there — Harry, stop it, come away —” 
She grabbed his arm and pulled, but he resisted. 
“Harry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius!” she said in a high-
pitched, strained voice. 
THE  DEPARTMENT 
OF  MYSTERIES 
 775  
“Sirius,” Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continu-
ously swaying veil. “Yeah . . .” 
And then something slid back into place in his brain: Sirius, cap-
tured, bound, and tortured, and he was staring at this archway. . . . 
He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes 
from the veil. 
“Let’s go,” he said. 
“That’s what I’ve been trying to — well, come on, then!” said 
Hermione, and she led the way back around the dais. On the other 
side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil 
too. Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny’s arm, Ron 
Neville’s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone 
bench and clambered all the way back up to the door. 
“What d’you reckon that arch was?” Harry asked Hermione as they 
regained the dark circular room. 
“I don’t know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,” she said 
firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door. 
Once more the wall spun and became still again. Harry approached 
a door at random and pushed. It did not move. 
“What’s wrong?” said Hermione. 
“It’s . . . locked . . .” said Harry, throwing his weight at the door, 
but it did not budge. 
“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the 
attempt to force the door open. “Bound to be!” 
“Get out of the way!” said Hermione sharply. She pointed her 
wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door 
and said, “Alohomora!” 
Nothing happened. 
“Sirius’s knife!” said Harry, and he pulled it out from inside his 
robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall. The 
others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom, withdrew 
it, and then flung his shoulder again at the door. It remained as firmly 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 776  
shut as ever. What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife, 
he saw that the blade had melted. 
“Right, we’re leaving that room,” said Hermione decisively. 
“But what if that’s the one?” said Ron, staring at it with a mixture 
of apprehension and longing. 
“It can’t be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,” 
said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry re-
placed the now-useless handle of Sirius’s knife in his pocket. 
“You know what could be in there?” said Luna eagerly, as the wall 
started to spin yet again. 
“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said Hermione under her 
breath, and Neville gave a nervous little laugh. 
The wall slid back to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing 
desperation, pushed the next door open. 
“This is it!” 
He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling 
light. As Harry’s eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare 
he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfa-
ther and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or stand-
ing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless 
ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching foot-
steps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering 
crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room. 
“This way!” 
Harry’s heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were 
on the right track. He led the way forward down the narrow space be-
tween the lines of the desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for 
the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that 
stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering 
wind. 
“Oh look!” said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very 
heart of the bell jar. 
THE  DEPARTMENT 
OF  MYSTERIES 
 777  
Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-
bright egg. As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird 
emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on 
the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the 
time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been en-
closed once more in its egg. 
“Keep going!” said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of 
wanting to stop and watch the egg’s progress back into a bird. 
“You dawdled enough by that old arch!” she said crossly, but fol-
lowed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it. 
“This is it,” Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so 
hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech. “It’s through 
here —” 
He glanced around at them all. They had their wands out and 
looked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door 
and pushed. It swung open. 
They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and 
full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs. 
They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets 
set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room be-
hind them, their flames were burning blue. The room was very cold. 
Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles 
between two rows of shelves. He could not hear anything nor see the 
slightest sign of movement. 
“You said it was row ninety-seven,” whispered Hermione. 
“Yeah,” breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row. 
Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glim-
mered the silver figure 53. 
“We need to go right, I think,” whispered Hermione, squinting to 
the next row. “Yes . . . that’s fifty-four. . . .” 
“Keep your wands out,” Harry said softly. 
They crept forward, staring behind them as they went on down the 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 778  
long alleys of shelves, the farther ends of which were in near total 
darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb 
on the shelf. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as 
dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs. 
They passed row eighty-four . . . eighty-five . . . Harry was listen-
ing hard for the slightest sound of movement, but Sirius might be 
gagged now, or else unconscious . . . or, said an unbidden voice inside 
his head, he might already be dead. . . . 
I’d have felt it, he told himself, his heart now hammering against his 
Adam’s apple. I’d already know. . . . 
“Ninety-seven!” whispered Hermione. 
They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the 
alley beside it. There was nobody there. 
“He’s right down at the end,” said Harry, whose mouth had be-
come slightly dry. “You can’t see properly from here. . . .” 
And he led them forward, between the towering rows of glass balls, 
some of which glowed softly as they passed. . . . 
“He should be near here,” whispered Harry, convinced that every 
step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view upon the 
darkened floor. “Anywhere here . . . really close . . .” 
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to re-
spond. His mouth was very dry now. 
“Somewhere about . . . here . . .” he said. 
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim 
candlelight. There was nobody there at all. All was echoing, dusty 
silence. 
“He might be . . .” Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the 
alley next door. “Or maybe . . .” He hurried to look down the one 
beyond that. 
“Harry?” said Hermione again. 
“What?” he snarled. 
 
THE  DEPARTMENT 
OF  MYSTERIES 
 779  
“I . . . I don’t think Sirius is here.” 
Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. He felt 
sick. He did not understand why Sirius was not here. He had to be 
here. This was where he, Harry, had seen him. . . . 
He ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them. 
Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past. He ran the other way, 
back past his staring companions. There was no sign of Sirius any-
where, nor any hint of a struggle. 
“Harry?” Ron called. 
“What?” 
He did not want to hear what Ron had to say, did not want to hear 
Ron tell him he had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back 
to Hogwarts. But the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though 
he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while be-
fore facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others’ accus-
ing stares. . . . 
“Have you seen this?” said Ron. 
“What?” said Harry, but eagerly this time — it had to be a sign that 
Sirius had been there, a clue — he strode back to where they were all 
standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing ex-
cept Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves. 
“What?” Harry repeated glumly. 
“It’s — it’s got your name on,” said Ron. 
Harry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small 
glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very 
dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years. 
“My name?” said Harry blankly. 
He stepped forward. Not as tall as Ron, he had to crane his neck to 
read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty 
glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years 
previously, and below that: 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FOUR 
 780  
S. P. T. to  A. P. W. B. D. 
Dark  Lord 
and (?) Harry Potter 
Harry stared at it. 
“What is it?” Ron asked, sounding unnerved. “What’s your name 
doing down here?” 
He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf. 
“I’m not here,” he said, sounding perplexed. “None of the rest of us 
are here. . . .” 
“Harry, I don’t think you should touch it,” said Hermione sharply, 
as he stretched out his hand. 
“Why not?” he said. “It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?” 
“Don’t, Harry,” said Neville suddenly. Harry looked around at 
him. Neville’s round face was shining slightly with sweat. He looked 
as though he could not take much more suspense. 
“It’s got my name on,” said Harry. 
And feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty 
ball’s surface. He had expected it to feel cold, but it did not. On the 
contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours, as 
though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hop-
ing, that something dramatic was going to happen, something excit-
ing that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile 
after all, he lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it. 
Nothing whatsoever happened. The others moved in closer around 
Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust. 
And then, from right behind them, a drawling voice said, “Very 
good, Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.”

lack shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, block-
ing their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a 
dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave 
a gasp of horror. 
“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he 
held out his hand, palm up. 
Harry’s insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and 
outnumbered two to one. 
“To me,” said Malfoy yet again. 
“Where’s Sirius?” Harry said. 
Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the 
midst of the shadowy figures to Harry’s left said triumphantly, “The 
Dark Lord always knows!” 
“Always,” echoed Malfoy softly. “Now, give me the prophecy, 
Potter.” 
“I want to know where Sirius is!” 
“I want to know where Sirius is!” mimicked the woman to his left. 
She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were 
B

 782  
mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands 
dazzling Harry’s eyes. 
“You’ve got him,” said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, 
the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-
seventh row. “He’s here. I know he is.” 
“The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was 
twoo,” said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron 
stir beside him. 
“Don’t do anything,” he muttered. “Not yet —” 
The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of 
laughter. 
“You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other chil-
dren as though he thinks of fighting us!” 
“Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,” said Malfoy softly. 
“He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this 
about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.” 
“I know Sirius is here,” said Harry, though panic was causing his 
chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. 
“I know you’ve got him!” 
More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed 
loudest of all. 
“It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Pot-
ter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me the prophecy, or we start using 
wands.” 
“Go on, then,” said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As 
he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna 
rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. If 
Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no 
reason at all. . . . 
But the Death Eaters did not strike. 
“Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,” said Malfoy 
coolly. 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 783  
It was Harry’s turn to laugh. 
“Yeah, right!” he said. “I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you’ll 
just let us skip off home, will you?” 
The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death 
Eater shrieked, “Accio Proph —” 
Harry was just ready for her. He shouted “Protego!” before she had 
finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his 
fingers he managed to cling on to it. 
“Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,” she said, her 
mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. “Very well, then —” 
“I TOLD YOU, NO!” Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. “If you 
smash it — !” 
Harry’s mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty 
spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get 
them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a ter-
rible price for his stupidity . . . 
The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off 
her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange’s face, making it 
gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. 
“You need more persuasion?” she said, her chest rising and falling 
rapidly. “Very well — take the smallest one,” she ordered the Death 
Eaters beside her. “Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I’ll 
do it.” 
Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways 
so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. 
“You’ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,” he told 
Bellatrix. “I don’t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back 
without it, will he?” 
She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue 
moistening her thin mouth. 
“So,” said Harry, “what kind of prophecy are we talking about 
anyway?” 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 784  
He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville’s arm 
was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel 
one of the other’s quickened breath on the back of his head. He was 
hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, be-
cause his mind was blank. 
“What kind of prophecy?” repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from 
her face. “You jest, Harry Potter.” 
“Nope, not jesting,” said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater 
to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they 
could escape. “How come Voldemort wants it?” 
Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. 
“You dare speak his name?” whispered Bellatrix. 
“Yeah,” said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, ex-
pecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. “Yeah, I’ve got no 
problem saying Vol —” 
“Shut your mouth!” Bellatrix shrieked. “You dare speak his name 
with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood’s 
tongue, you dare —” 
“Did you know he’s a half-blood too?” said Harry recklessly. 
Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. “Voldemort? Yeah, his mother 
was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot 
he’s pureblood?” 
“STUPEF —” 
“NO!” 
A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s 
wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the 
shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there 
shattered. 
Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled them-
selves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began 
to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments  
 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 785  
of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix’s 
shouts. 
“. . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .” said the figure of an old, 
bearded man. 
“DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!” 
“He dared — he dares —” shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. “— He 
stands there — filthy half-blood —” 
“WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY!” bawled Malfoy. 
“. . . and none will come after . . .” said the figure of a young woman. 
The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had 
melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile 
homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, 
given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the 
others. 
“You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m sup-
posed to be handing over,” he said, playing for time. He moved his 
foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else’s. 
“Do not play games with us, Potter,” said Malfoy. 
“I’m not playing games,” said Harry, half his mind on the conver-
sation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone’s toes 
and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him 
told him they were Hermione’s. 
“What?” she whispered. 
“Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was 
hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said Malfoy 
sneeringly. 
“I — what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. 
“What about my scar?” 
“What?” whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. 
“Can this be?” said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some 
of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 786  
laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possi-
ble, “Smash shelves —” 
“Dumbledore never told you?” Malfoy repeated. “Well, this ex-
plains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered 
why —” 
“— when I say go —” 
“— you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where 
it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would 
make you want to hear the exact wording. . . .” 
“Did he?” said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard 
Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep 
talking, to distract the Death Eaters. “So he wanted me to come and 
get it, did he? Why?” 
“Why?” Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. “Because the 
only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the De-
partment of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as 
the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it 
for him.” 
“And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?” 
“About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven’t you ever 
wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?” 
Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy’s gray 
eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry’s parents had 
died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to 
all of this clutched in his hand? 
“Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?” he said 
quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm 
glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still 
gritty with dust. “And he’s made me come and get it for him? Why 
couldn’t he come and get it himself?” 
“Get it himself?” shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter.  
 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 787  
“The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so 
sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Au-
rors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear 
cousin?” 
“So he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?” said Harry. 
“Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?” 
“Very good, Potter, very good . . .” said Malfoy slowly. “But the 
Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —” 
“NOW!” yelled Harry. 
Five different voices behind him bellowed “REDUCTO!” Five 
curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them 
exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass 
spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and 
floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead 
past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now rain-
ing down upon the floor — 
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and 
more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of 
Hermione’s robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as 
chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A 
Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry el-
bowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were 
cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon them-
selves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their 
spheres — 
Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna 
sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck 
him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and 
sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Her-
mione shout “Stupefy!” and the hand released him at once. 
They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 788  
began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him 
and Hermione’s voice urging Neville on. The door through which 
they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering 
light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched 
tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the 
threshold before slamming the door behind them — 
“Colloportus!” gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an 
odd squelching noise. 
“Where — where are the others?” gasped Harry. 
He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of  
them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody 
there. 
“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered Hermione, ter-
ror in her face. 
“Listen!” whispered Neville. 
Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just 
sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius 
Malfoy roar: “Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care 
for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come 
back here, we need to organize! We’ll split into pairs and search, and 
don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you 
can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the 
left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight 
ahead — Macnair and Avery, through here — Rookwood, over 
there — Mulciber, come with me!” 
“What do we do?” Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to 
foot. 
“Well, we don’t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,” 
said Harry. “Let’s get away from this door. . . .” 
They ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where 
the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the  
 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 789  
circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there 
when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door 
Hermione had charmed shut. 
“Stand aside!” said a rough voice. “Alohomora!” 
As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under 
desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes 
drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. 
“They might’ve run straight through to the hall,” said the rough 
voice. 
“Check under the desks,” said another. 
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out 
from under the desk he shouted, “STUPEFY !” 
A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into 
a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, 
however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry’s spell and now pointed his 
own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to 
get a better aim. 
“Avada —” 
Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death 
Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. 
Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand 
wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS !” 
Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands 
and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both 
scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in 
front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly 
horrorstruck at what he had done. 
“Get out of the way, Harry!” yelled Neville, clearly determined to 
repair the damage. 
Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and 
shouted, “STUPEFY !” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 790  
The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and 
hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-
glasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying every-
where, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell 
down again, and shattered — 
The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor 
beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk 
as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he 
ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, “STUP —” 
“STUPEFY !” screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with 
them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his 
chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a 
clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected 
to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto 
the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar 
as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, 
sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar 
full of glittering wind. 
“Accio Wand!” cried Hermione. Harry’s wand flew from a dark cor-
ner into her hand and she threw it to him. 
“Thanks,” he said, “right, let’s get out of —” 
“Look out!” said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater’s 
head in the bell jar. 
All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them 
struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was 
happening to the man’s head. 
It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair 
and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull 
round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . . 
A baby’s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled 
neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as 
they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previ-
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 791  
ous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate 
and chin. . . . 
“It’s time,” said Hermione in an awestruck voice. “Time . . .” 
The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but 
before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to 
babyhood once more. . . . 
There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. 
“RON?” Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous trans-
formation taking place before them. “GINNY? LUNA?” 
“Harry!” Hermione screamed. 
The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His ap-
pearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby’s head bawling loudly while 
his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing 
Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement 
Hermione seized his arm. 
“You can’t hurt a baby!” 
There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more foot-
steps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and 
knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their 
position. 
“Come on!” he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death 
Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood 
ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. 
They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open 
door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward 
them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office 
and slammed the door behind them. 
“Collo —” began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell 
the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come 
hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, “IMPEDIMENTA!” 
Harry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their 
feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 792  
Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a 
cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the 
stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a 
moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. 
“WE’VE GOT HIM!” yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, “IN 
AN OFFICE OFF —” 
“Silencio!” cried Hermione, and the man’s voice was extinguished. 
He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound 
came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow. 
“Petrificus Totalus!” shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised 
his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, 
facedown onto the rug at Harry’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to 
move at all. 
“Well done, Ha —” 
But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sud-
den slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of 
what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione’s chest; 
she gave a tiny “oh!” as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the 
floor where she lay motionless. 
“HERMIONE!” 
Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward 
her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death 
Eater kicked out hard at Neville’s head as he emerged — his foot 
broke Neville’s wand in two and connected with his face — Neville 
gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry 
twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death 
Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at 
Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily 
Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the 
Prewetts. 
Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the 
prophecy still clutched in Harry’s hand, to himself, then at Hermione. 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 793  
Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been 
clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . . 
“Like you won’t kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!” said 
Harry. 
A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking 
properly. He had one hand on Hermione’s shoulder, which was still 
warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don’t let her be dead, don’t 
let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead. . . . 
“Whaddever you do, Harry,” said Neville fiercely from under the 
desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood 
pouring down his mouth and chin, “don’d gib it to him!” 
Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over 
his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the 
doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at 
everything around him. 
Harry seized his chance: “PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!” 
The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled for-
ward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to 
move an inch. 
“Hermione,” Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed 
Death Eater blundered out of sight again. “Hermione, wake up. . . .” 
“Whaddid he do to her?” said Neville, crawling out from under the 
desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly 
swelling nose. “I dunno. . . .” 
Neville groped for Hermione’s wrist. 
“Dat’s a pulse, Harry, I’b sure id is. . . .” 
Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a mo-
ment he felt light-headed. 
“She’s alive?” 
“Yeah, I dink so. . . .” 
There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 794  
more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunder-
ings of the baby Death Eater in the next room. 
“Neville, we’re not far from the exit,” Harry whispered. “We’re 
right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it 
and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet 
you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you 
could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .” 
“And whad are you going do do?” said Neville, mopping his bleed-
ing nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. 
“I’ve got to find the others,” said Harry. 
“Well, I’b going do find dem wid you,” said Neville firmly. 
“But Hermione —” 
“We’ll dake her wid us,” said Neville firmly. “I’ll carry her — you’re 
bedder at fighding dem dan I ab —” 
He stood up and seized one of Hermione’s arms, glared at Harry, 
who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione’s 
limp form over Neville’s shoulders. 
“Wait,” said Harry, snatching up Hermione’s wand from the floor 
and shoving it into Nevilles hand, “you’d better take this. . . .” 
Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they 
walked slowly toward the door. 
“My gran’s going do kill be,” said Neville thickly, blood spattering 
from his nose as he spoke, “dat was by dad’s old wand. . . .” 
Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. 
The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into 
things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling 
and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had 
contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on 
the wall behind them. 
“He’s never going to notice us,” he whispered. “C’mon . . . keep 
close behind me. . . .” 
 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 795  
They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the 
black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a 
few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione’s 
weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and 
the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of 
Harry’s head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, 
swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking 
heart Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the 
doors. 
“So which way d’you reck — ?” 
But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a 
door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. 
“Ron!” croaked Harry, dashing toward them. “Ginny — are you 
all — ?” 
“Harry,” said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the 
front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. “There 
you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You’re all messed 
up. . . . 
Ron’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from 
the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but 
he still clutched the front of Harry’s robes, so that Harry was pulled 
into a kind of bow. 
“Ginny?” Harry said fearfully. “What happened?” 
But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting po-
sition, panting and holding her ankle. 
“I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack,” whispered 
Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. 
“Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very 
odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark —” 
“Harry, we saw Uranus up close!” said Ron, still giggling feebly. 
“Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha —” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 796  
A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst. 
“Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor 
Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .” 
Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very 
shallow way, her eyes still closed. 
“And what about Ron?” said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to 
giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry’s robes. 
“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but he’s 
gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all. . . .” 
“Harry,” said Ron, pulling Harry’s ear down to his mouth and still 
giggling weakly, “you know who this girl is, Harry? She’s Loony . . . 
Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .” 
“We’ve got to get out of here,” said Harry firmly. “Luna, can you 
help Ginny?” 
“Yes,” said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, 
putting an arm around Ginny’s waist and pulling her up. 
“It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!” said Ginny impatiently, but 
next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for sup-
port. Harry pulled Ron’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many 
months ago, he had pulled Dudley’s. He looked around: They had a 
one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time — 
He heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it 
when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters 
sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. 
“There they are!” she shrieked. 
Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way 
through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and 
ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the 
threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. 
“Colloportus!” shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into 
the door on the other side. 
 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 797  
“It doesn’t matter!” said a man’s voice. “There are other ways in — 
WE’VE GOT THEM, THEY’RE HERE!” 
Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure 
enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps 
in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join 
the first. 
“Luna — Neville — help me!” 
The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they 
went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his 
haste to reach the next door. 
“Colloportus!” 
There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now 
and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it 
creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors 
along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the 
room, he heard Luna cry, “Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . .” 
He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death 
Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not 
reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the 
floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. 
“Get Potter!” shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her 
and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought 
they might hit the prophecy — 
“Hey!” said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now totter-
ing drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. “Hey, Harry, there are brains in 
here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, Harry?” 
“Ron, get out of the way, get down —” 
But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. 
“Honest, Harry, they’re brains — look — Accio Brain!” 
The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville 
and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 798  
the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leap-
ing fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared 
toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of 
moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film — 
“Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —” said Ron, watching it disgorge its 
gaudy innards. “Harry, come and touch it, bet it’s weird —” 
“RON, NO!” 
Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tenta-
cles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would 
not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught 
the brain in his outstretched hands. 
The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began 
wrapping themselves around Ron’s arms like ropes. 
“Harry, look what’s happen — no — no, I don’t like it — no, 
stop — stop —” 
But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now. He 
tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like 
an octopus’s body. 
“Diffindo!” yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping them-
selves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. 
Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. 
“Harry, it’ll suffocate him!” screamed Ginny, immobilized by her 
broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of 
the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled 
over sideways and lay there unconscious. 
“STUBEFY!” shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving 
Hermione’s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. “STUBEFY, 
STUBEFY !” 
But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own 
Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville 
were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of 
whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters

in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange 
sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he 
sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw 
the Death Eaters away from the others. 
It seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs 
and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the 
prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one 
through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly pray-
ing that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing 
him — he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor 
vanish — 
He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bounc-
ing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath 
out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the 
stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the 
Death Eaters’ laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been 
in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more 
emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to 
bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trem-
bling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still 
miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in 
his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the 
Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something 
solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed 
backward onto it. 
The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as 
hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full 
Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry’s face. 
“Potter, your race is run,” drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his 
mask. “Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy. . . .” 
“Let — let the others go, and I’ll give it to you!” said Harry 
desperately. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 800  
A few of the Death Eaters laughed. 
“You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy, 
his pale face flushed with pleasure. “You see, there are ten of us and 
only one of you . . . or hasn’t Dumbledore ever taught you how to 
count?” 
“He’s dot alone!” shouted a voice from above them. “He’s still god 
be!” 
Harry’s heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches 
toward them, Hermione’s wand held fast in his trembling hand. 
“Neville — no — go back to Ron —” 
“STUBEFY!” Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each 
Death Eater in turn, “STUBEFY ! STUBE —” 
One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pin-
ioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the 
Death Eaters laughed. 
“It’s Longbottom, isn’t it?” sneered Lucius Malfoy. “Well, your 
grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your 
death will not come as a great shock. . . .” 
“Longbottom?” repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her 
gaunt face. “Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, 
boy. . . .” 
“I DOE YOU HAB!” roared Neville, and he fought so hard against 
his captor’s encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, “Someone 
Stun him!” 
“No, no, no,” said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with ex-
citement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. “No, let’s see 
how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Un-
less Potter wants to give us the prophecy —” 
“DON’D GIB ID DO DEM!” roared Neville, who seemed beside 
himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his 
captor, her wand raised. “DON’D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!” 
Bellatrix raised her wand. “Crucio!” 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 801  
Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death 
Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The 
Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and 
screaming in agony. 
“That was just a taster!” said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that 
Neville’s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned 
and gazed up at Harry. “Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or 
watch your little friend die the hard way!” 
Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy 
was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Mal-
foy jumped forward to take it. 
Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more 
people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and 
Kingsley. 
Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a 
Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had 
made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters 
were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the 
Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped 
from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bod-
ies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He 
dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to 
reach Neville. 
“Are you okay?” he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their 
heads. 
“Yes,” said Neville, trying to pull himself up. 
“And Ron?” 
“I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I 
left —” 
The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a 
crater right where Neville’s hand had been seconds before. Both 
scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 802  
seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes 
were barely touching the floor. 
“Give it to me,” growled a voice in his ear, “give me the 
prophecy —” 
The man was pressing so tightly on Harry’s windpipe that he could 
not breathe — through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a 
Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; 
Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bel-
latrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He 
turned his wand backward toward the man’s side, but had no breath 
to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping toward 
the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy — 
“AARGH!” 
Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a 
spell, he had jabbed Hermione’s wand hard into the eyehole of the 
Death Eater’s mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of 
pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, “STUPEFY!” 
The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It 
was Macnair, Buckbeak’s would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen 
and bloodshot. 
“Thanks!” Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his 
Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were 
blurs. Then Harry’s foot made contact with something round and 
hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the 
prophecy, then saw Moody’s magic eye spinning away across the floor. 
Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his at-
tacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his 
long pale face twisted with glee. 
“Tarantallegra!” he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose 
legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing 
him and causing him to fall to the floor again. “Now, Potter —” 
 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 803  
He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had 
used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Protego!” 
Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the 
force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville’s jerking 
legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. 
Dolohov raised his wand again. “Accio Proph —” 
Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, 
and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to 
the tips of Harry’s fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sir-
ius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, 
sparks flying from their wand tips — 
Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement 
he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, 
“Petrificus Totalus!” Once again, Dolohov’s arms and legs snapped to-
gether and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back. 
“Nice one!” shouted Sirius, forcing Harry’s head down as a pair of 
Stunning Spells flew toward them. “Now I want you to get out of —” 
They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed 
Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the 
stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and 
Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray. 
“Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!” Sirius yelled, 
dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: 
Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pock-
marked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew 
over Harry’s head as he launched himself toward Neville — 
“Can you stand?” he bellowed in Neville’s ear, as Neville’s legs jerked 
and twitched uncontrollably. “Put your arm round my neck —” 
Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville’s legs were still flying in 
every direction, they would not support him and then, out of 
nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville’s legs  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 804  
waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, Harry with his left arm held 
up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed. 
“The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!” snarled Lucius Mal-
foy’s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy’s wand pressing 
hard between his ribs. 
“No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it!” 
Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself 
around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed 
the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over 
his shoulder and yelled, “Impedimenta!” 
Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he 
looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius 
and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and 
Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had 
jumped between them. 
“Harry, round up the others and GO!” 
Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him 
bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville’s legs twitched and 
jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all 
the strength he possessed and they climbed another step — 
A spell hit the stone bench at Harry’s heel. It crumbled away and 
he fell back to the step below: Neville sank to the ground, his legs still 
jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket. 
“Come on!” said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville’s robes. “Just 
try and push with your legs —” 
He gave another stupendous heave and Neville’s robes tore all along 
the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket 
and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville’s floundering 
feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the 
step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had 
broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with  
 
BEYOND  THE  VEIL 
 805  
hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. 
Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams 
and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he 
hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. 
“Harry, I’b sorry!” cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs con-
tinued to flounder, “I’b so sorry, Harry, I didn’d bean do —” 
“It doesn’t matter!” Harry shouted. “Just try and stand, let’s get out 
of —” 
“Dubbledore!” said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, 
staring over Harry’s shoulder. 
“What?” 
“DUBBLEDORE!” 
Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above 
them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus 
Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a 
kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they 
were saved. 
Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had 
no more thought of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of 
the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There 
were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey 
up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore’s spell pulled him back as 
easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible 
line — 
Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new 
arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: He was laugh-
ing at her. “Come on, you can do better than that!” he yelled, his voice 
echoing around the cavernous room. 
The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. 
The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened 
in shock. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-FIVE 
 806  
Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was 
jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore 
turned to the dais too. 
It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a grace-
ful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the 
arch. . . . 
And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his god-
father’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient 
doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a mo-
ment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. 
Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s triumphant scream, but knew it 
meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he 
would reappear from the other side any second. . . . 
But Sirius did not reappear. 
“SIRIUS!” Harry yelled, “SIRIUS!” 
He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius 
must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out 
again. . . . 
But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin 
grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. 
“There’s nothing you can do, Harry —” 
“Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!” 
“It’s too late, Harry —” 
“We can still reach him —” 
Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . . 
“There’s nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He’s gone.”

e hasn’t gone!” Harry yelled. 
He did not believe it, he would not believe it; still he 
fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had: Lupin did not under-
stand, people hid behind that curtain, he had heard them whispering 
the first time he had entered the room — Sirius was hiding, simply 
lurking out of sight — 
“SIRIUS!” he bellowed, “SIRIUS!” 
“He can’t come back, Harry,” said Lupin, his voice breaking as he 
struggled to contain Harry. “He can’t come back, because he’s d —” 
“HE — IS — NOT — DEAD!” roared Harry. “SIRIUS!” 
There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, 
the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the de-
flected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered ex-
cept that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing feet 
from them behind that old curtain, was not going to emerge at any 
moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle — 
Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais, Harry still staring at the 
archway, angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting — 
H 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX 
 808  
But some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from 
Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before. . . . Sirius had 
risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him. . . . If Sirius was 
not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him 
as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was 
that he could not come back. . . . That he really was . . . 
Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in 
the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes. 
Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay and 
was attempting to revive her. Behind the dais there were still flashes of 
light, grunts, and cries — Kingsley had run forward to continue Sir-
ius’s duel with Bellatrix. 
“Harry?” 
Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place 
where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, 
who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless. 
“Harry . . . I’b really sorry. . . .” said Neville. His legs were still 
dancing uncontrollably. “Was dat man — was Sirius Black a — a 
friend of yours?” 
Harry nodded. 
“Here,” said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville’s legs 
he said, “Finite.” The spell was lifted. Neville’s legs fell back onto the 
floor and remained still. Lupin’s face was pale. “Let’s — let’s find the 
others. Where are they all, Neville?” 
Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as 
though every word was causing him pain. 
“Dey’re all back dere,” said Neville. “A brain addacked Ron bud I 
dink he’s all righd — and Herbione’s unconscious, bud we could feel 
a bulse —” 
There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw 
Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the ground. Bellatrix Lestrange turned  
 
THE  ONLY  ONE

 809  
tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her 
but she deflected it. She was halfway up the steps now — 
“Harry — no!” cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm 
from Lupin’s slackened grip. 
“SHE KILLED SIRIUS!” bellowed Harry. “SHE KILLED HIM 
— I’LL KILL HER!” 
And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches. People were 
shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix’s robes 
whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the 
brains were swimming. . . . 
She aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and 
tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within. The 
brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long, col-
ored tentacles, but he shouted, “Wingardium Leviosa!” and they flew 
into the air away from him. Slipping and sliding he ran on toward the 
door. He leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny, 
who said, “Harry — what — ?” past Ron, who giggled feebly, and 
Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door 
into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a 
door on the other side of the room — beyond her was the corridor 
leading back to the lifts. 
He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls 
had begun to rotate again. Once more he was surrounded by streaks 
of blue light from the whirling candelabra. 
“Where’s the exit?” he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a 
halt again. “Where’s the way out?” 
The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door 
right behind him flew open, and the corridor toward the lifts stretched 
ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran. . . . 
He could hear a lift clattering ahead of him. He sprinted up the 
passageway, swung around the corner, and slammed his fist onto the  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX 
 810  
button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the 
grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button 
marked Atrium. The doors slid shut and he was rising. . . . 
He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open 
and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the 
other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted toward her, 
and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of 
Magical Brethren; the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold 
gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells. There 
were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched be-
hind the statues, listening. 
“Come out, come out, little Harry!” she called in her mock-baby voice, 
which echoed off the polished wooden floors. “What did you come af-
ter me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!” 
“I am!” shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry’s seemed to 
chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room. 
“Aaaaaah . . . did you love him, little baby Potter?” 
Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before. He flung 
himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed “Crucio!” 
Bellatrix screamed. The spell had knocked her off her feet, but she 
did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had — she was already 
on her feet again, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged be-
hind the golden fountain again — her counterspell hit the head of the 
handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, 
gouging long scratches into the wooden floor. 
“Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she 
yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean 
them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain — to enjoy it — 
righteous anger won’t hurt me for long — I’ll show you how it is 
done, shall I? I’ll give you a lesson —” 
Harry had been edging around the fountain on the other side. She 
screamed, “Crucio!” and he was forced to duck down again as the cen-

 811  
taur’s arm, holding its bow, spun off and landed with a crash on the 
floor a short distance from the golden wizard’s head. 
“Potter, you cannot win against me!” she cried. He could hear her 
moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed 
around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur’s legs, 
his head level with the house-elf’s. “I was and am the Dark Lord’s 
most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know 
spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to 
compete —” 
“Stupefy!” yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the 
goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at 
her back as she peered around the fountain for him. She reacted so fast 
he barely had time to duck. 
“Protego!” 
The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him. 
Harry scrambled back behind the fountain, and one of the goblin’s 
ears went flying across the room. 
“Potter, I am going to give you one chance!” shouted Bellatrix. 
“Give me the prophecy — roll it out toward me now — and I may 
spare your life!” 
“Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone!” Harry 
roared — and as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead. His 
scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite un-
connected with his own rage. “And he knows!” said Harry with a mad 
laugh to match Bellatrix’s own. “Your dear old mate Voldemort knows 
it’s gone! He’s not going to be happy with you, is he?” 
“What? What do you mean?” she cried, and for the first time there 
was fear in her voice. 
“The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the 
steps! What do you think Voldemort’ll say about that, then?” 
His scar seared and burned. . . . The pain of it was making his eyes 
stream. . . . 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX 
 812  
“LIAR!” she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger 
now. “YOU’VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT 
TO ME — Accio Prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY!” 
Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the 
pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst. 
He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and 
withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him. 
“Nothing there!” he shouted. “Nothing to summon! It smashed 
and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that —” 
“No!” she screamed. “It isn’t true, you’re lying — MASTER, I 
TRIED, I TRIED — DO NOT PUNISH ME —” 
“Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against 
the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. “He can’t hear you 
from here!” 
“Can’t I, Potter?” said a high, cold voice. 
Harry opened his eyes. 
Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and 
gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes staring . . . Lord Voldemort had 
appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who 
stood frozen, quite unable to move. 
“So you smashed my prophecy?” said Voldemort softly, staring at 
Harry with those pitiless red eyes. “No, Bella, he is not lying. . . . I see 
the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind. . . . Months 
of preparation, months of effort . . . and my Death Eaters have let 
Harry Potter thwart me again. . . .” 
“Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus 
Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort’s feet as 
he paced slowly nearer. “Master, you should know —” 
“Be quiet, Bella,” said Voldemort dangerously. “I shall deal with 
you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic 
to hear your sniveling apologies?” 
“But Master — he is here — he is below —” 
THE  ONLY  ONE 
HE  EVER FEARED 
 813  
Voldemort paid no attention. 
“I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,” he said quietly. “You 
have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!” 
Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist. His mind was 
blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor. 
But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had 
sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a 
crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its 
chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry. 
“What — ?” said Voldemort, staring around. And then he 
breathed, “Dumbledore!” 
Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was 
standing in front of the golden gates. 
Voldemort raised his wand and sent another jet of green light at 
Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak; 
next second he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his 
wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to 
life too. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and 
sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pin-
ning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled 
toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur 
galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. 
The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as 
Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur can-
tered around them both. 
“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore 
calmly. “The Aurors are on their way —” 
“By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He 
sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting 
the security guards desk, which burst into flame. 
Dumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that em-
anated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX 
 814  
guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort 
was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect 
it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, 
though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling 
sound. . . . 
“You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his 
scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality, 
are you?” 
“We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, 
Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Volde-
mort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had 
happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. “Merely taking your life 
would not satisfy me, I admit —” 
“There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!” snarled 
Voldemort. 
“You are quite wrong,” said Dumbledore, still closing in upon 
Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the 
matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, unde-
fended, shieldless. He wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless 
guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall, blocking his 
every attempt to get out from behind it. “Indeed, your failure to un-
derstand that there are things much worse than death has always been 
your greatest weakness —” 
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This 
time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, 
that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the 
fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his 
wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame 
flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all. 
For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery 
rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold upon Voldemort 
at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore. 
THE  ONLY  ONE 
HE  EVER FEARED 
 815  
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to 
strike — 
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as 
Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the 
pool where so recently the five statues had stood. 
“Look out!” Harry yelled. 
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at 
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — 
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak 
wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame 
and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same mo-
ment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one, long, fluid move-
ment — the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs 
into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; 
the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of 
molten glass — 
For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, 
faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly 
struggling to throw off the suffocating mass — 
Then he was gone, and the water fell with a crash back into its 
pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor. 
“MASTER!” screamed Bellatrix. 
Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to 
run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed, 
“Stay where you are, Harry!” 
For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could 
not see why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing 
Bellatrix still trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes 
croaking feebly on the floor — 
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was 
pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance — 
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX 
 816  
with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his 
body ended and the creature’s began. They were fused together, 
bound by pain, and there was no escape — 
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his 
agony he felt his jaw move. . . . 
“Kill me now, Dumbledore. . . .” 
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry 
felt the creature use him again. . . . 
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy. . . .” 
Let the pain stop, thought Harry. Let him kill us. . . . End it, Dumb-
ledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . . 
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . . 
And as Harry’s heart filled with emotion, the creature’s coils loos-
ened, the pain was gone, Harry was lying facedown on the floor, his 
glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood. . . . 
And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than 
there should have been: Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying at 
the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which 
now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and 
raised his head an inch to find Dumbledore’s crooked nose inches 
from his own. 
“Are you all right, Harry?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head 
up properly. “Yeah, I’m — where’s Voldemort, where — who are all 
these — what’s —” 
The Atrium was full of people. The floor was reflecting emerald-
green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall, 
and a stream of witches and wizards was emerging from them. As 
Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold stat-
ues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a stunned-looking Cor-
nelius Fudge forward. 
“He was there!” shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who 
THE  ONLY  ONE 
HE  EVER FEARED 
 817  
was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, 
where Bellatrix had lain trapped moments before. “I saw him, Mr. 
Fudge, I swear, it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and 
Disapparated!” 
“I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!” gibbered Fudge, who 
was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as 
though he had just run miles. “Merlin’s beard — here — here! — in 
the Ministry of Magic! — great heavens above — it doesn’t seem pos-
sible — my word — how can this be?” 
“If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cor-
nelius,” said Dumbledore, apparently satisfied that Harry was all 
right, and walking forward so that the newcomers realized he was 
there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands, others sim-
ply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and 
Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor), “you 
will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Cham-
ber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision 
as to what to do with them.” 
“Dumbledore!” gasped Fudge, apparently beside himself with 
amazement. “You — here — I — I —” 
He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him, 
and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, 
“Seize him!” 
“Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men — and win again!” said 
Dumbledore in a thunderous voice. “But a few minutes ago you saw 
proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a 
year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong 
men for twelve months, and it is time you listened to sense!” 
“I — don’t — well —” blustered Fudge, looking around as though 
hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody 
did, he said, “Very well — Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the De-
partment of Mysteries and see . . . Dumbledore, you — you will need 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SIX 
 818  
to tell me exactly — the Fountain of Magical Brethren — what hap-
pened?” he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor, 
where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard, and centaur 
now lay scattered. 
“We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,” 
said Dumbledore. 
“Harry — Harry Potter?” 
Fudge spun around and stared at Harry, who was still standing 
against the wall beside the fallen statue that had been guarding him 
during Dumbledore and Voldemort’s duel. 
“He-here?” said Fudge. “Why — what’s all this about?” 
“I shall explain everything,” repeated Dumbledore, “when Harry is 
back at school.” 
He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wiz-
ard’s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered, 
“Portus.” The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the 
wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more. 
“Now see here, Dumbledore!” said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked 
up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. “You haven’t got 
authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in 
front of the Minister of Magic, you — you —” 
His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over 
his half-moon spectacles. 
“You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hog-
warts,” said Dumbledore. “You will tell your Aurors to stop searching 
for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to 
work. I will give you . . .” Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve 
hands from his pocket and glanced at it, “half an hour of my time 
tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the im-
portant points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to 
return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of  
 
THE  ONLY  ONE

 819  
course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters ad-
dressed to the headmaster will find me.” 
Fudge goggled worse than ever. His mouth was open and his round 
face grew pinker under his rumpled gray hair. 
“I — you —” 
Dumbledore turned his back on him. 
“Take this Portkey, Harry.” 
He held out the golden head of the statue, and Harry placed his 
hand upon it, past caring what he did next or where he went. 
“I shall see you in half an hour,” said Dumbledore quietly. “One 
. . . two . . . three . . .” 
Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his 
navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the 
Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had all disappeared, and he was fly-
ing forward in a whirlwind of color and sound. . . .

THE LOST PROPHECY 
 
 
 
arry’s feet hit solid ground again; his knees buckled a little 
and the golden wizard’s head fell with a resounding clunk to 
the floor. He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumble-
dore’s office. 
Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmaster’s 
absence. The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindle-
legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely. The portraits of the 
headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads 
lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of their pictures. Harry 
looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along 
the horizon: Dawn was approaching. 
The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or 
snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him. If his sur-
roundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures 
would have been screaming in pain. He walked around the quiet, 
beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he had to 
think. . . . There was no escape. . . . 
It was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had 
H 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 821  
not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort’s trick, if he had not 
been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he 
had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as 
Hermione had said, banking on Harry’s love of playing the hero . . . 
It was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand 
it. . . . There was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel 
or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had van-
ished. He did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent 
space, he could not stand it — 
A picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and 
a cool voice said, “Ah . . . Harry Potter . . .” 
Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he 
watched Harry with shrewd, narrow eyes. 
“And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?” said 
Phineas. “This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful 
headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me . . .” 
He gave another shuddering yawn. “Another message for my worth-
less great-great-grandson?” 
Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius 
was dead, but Harry could not tell him. To say it aloud would be to 
make it final, absolute, irretrievable. 
A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being inter-
rogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob. 
It would not turn. He was shut in. 
“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who 
hung on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk, “that Dumbledore will 
soon be back with us?” 
Harry turned. The wizard was eyeing him with great interest. Harry 
nodded. He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it 
remained immovable. 
“Oh good,” said the wizard. “It has been very dull without him, 
very dull indeed.” 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 822  
He settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been 
painted and smiled benignly upon Harry. 
“Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,” he 
said comfortably. “Oh yes. Holds you in great esteem.” 
The guilt filling the whole of Harry’s chest like some monstrous, 
weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand 
this, he could not stand being Harry anymore. . . . He had never felt 
more trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely 
that he could be somebody — anybody — else. . . . 
The empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making Harry 
leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate. 
As Dumbledore’s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards 
and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake. Many of them 
gave cries of welcome. 
“Thank you,” said Dumbledore softly. 
He did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch be-
side the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the 
tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of 
soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usu-
ally stood. 
“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the 
baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow stu-
dents are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.” 
Harry tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out. It seemed to 
him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage 
he had caused by his actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was 
for once looking at him directly, and though his expression was kindly 
rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes. 
“Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,” said Dumble-
dore. “Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. 
Mungo’s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery.” 
 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 823  
Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was 
growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure that all the 
portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dum-
bledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been 
and why there had been injuries. 
“I know how you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumbledore very 
quietly. 
“No, you don’t,” said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and 
strong. White-hot anger leapt inside him. Dumbledore knew nothing 
about his feelings. 
“You see, Dumbledore?” said Phineas Nigellus slyly. “Never try to 
understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be 
tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own —” 
“That’s enough, Phineas,” said Dumbledore. 
Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly 
out of the opposite window. He could see the Quidditch stadium in 
the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy 
black dog, so he could watch Harry play. . . . He had probably come 
to see whether Harry was as good as James had been. . . . Harry had 
never asked him. . . . 
“There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumble-
dore’s voice. “On the contrary . . . the fact that you can feel pain like 
this is your greatest strength.” 
Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terri-
ble emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his 
calmness and his empty words. 
“My greatest strength, is it?” said Harry, his voice shaking as he 
stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. “You haven’t 
got a clue. . . . You don’t know . . .” 
“What don’t I know?” asked Dumbledore calmly. 
It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 824  
“I don’t want to talk about how I feel, all right?” 
“Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is 
part of being human —” 
“THEN — I — DON’T — WANT — TO — BE — HUMAN!” 
Harry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from 
the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room. It 
shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the 
pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando 
Dippet said, “Really!” 
“I DON’T CARE!” Harry yelled at them, snatching up a luna-
scope and throwing it into the fireplace. “I’VE HAD ENOUGH, 
I’VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I 
DON’T CARE ANYMORE —” 
He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and 
threw that too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in dif-
ferent directions. 
“You do care,” said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a 
single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was 
calm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will 
bleed to death with the pain of it.” 
“I — DON’T!” Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat 
might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and 
break him too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make 
him feel some tiny part of the horror inside Harry. 
“Oh yes, you do,” said Dumbledore, still more calmly. “You have 
now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent 
you have ever known. Of course you care.” 
“YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL!” Harry roared. “YOU — 
STANDING THERE — YOU —” 
But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more 
help. He wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look 
back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 825  
staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He ran to the door, seized 
the doorknob again, and wrenched at it. 
But the door would not open. 
Harry turned back to Dumbledore. 
“Let me out,” he said. He was shaking from head to foot. 
“No,” said Dumbledore simply. 
For a few seconds they stared at each other. 
“Let me out,” Harry said again. 
“No,” Dumbledore repeated. 
“If you don’t — if you keep me in here — if you don’t let me —” 
“By all means continue destroying my possessions,” said Dumble-
dore serenely. “I daresay I have too many.” 
He walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching 
Harry. 
“Let me out,” Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and al-
most as calm as Dumbledore’s. 
“Not until I have had my say,” said Dumbledore. 
“Do you — do you think I want to — do you think I give a — I 
DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO SAY!” Harry roared. “I 
don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to say!” 
“You will,” said Dumbledore sadly. “Because you are not nearly as 
angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know 
you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.” 
“What are you talking — ?” 
“It is my fault that Sirius died,” said Dumbledore clearly. “Or I 
should say almost entirely my fault — I will not be so arrogant as to 
claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and ener-
getic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hid-
ing while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should 
never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you 
to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with 
you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 826  
ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of 
Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there 
tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That 
blame lies with me, and with me alone.” 
Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but he was 
unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, lis-
tening yet barely understanding what he was hearing. 
“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a 
request. 
Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered 
with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dum-
bledore’s desk. 
“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry’s 
left, “that my great-great-grandson — the last of the Blacks — is 
dead?” 
“Yes, Phineas,” said Dumbledore. 
“I don’t believe it,” said Phineas brusquely. 
Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his 
portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in 
Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, 
calling for Sirius through the house. . . . 
“Harry, I owe you an explanation,” said Dumbledore. “An explana-
tion of an old man’s mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, 
and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the fail-
ings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men 
are guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have 
forgotten lately. . . .” 
The sun was rising properly now. There was a rim of dazzling or-
ange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and 
bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eye-
brows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his face. 
“I guessed, fifteen years ago,” said Dumbledore, “when I saw the 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 827  
scar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might 
be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.” 
“You’ve told me this before, Professor,” said Harry bluntly. He did 
not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much 
anymore. 
“Yes,” said Dumbledore apologetically. “Yes, but you see — it is 
necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after 
you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar 
was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else 
feeling powerful emotion.” 
“I know,” said Harry wearily. 
“And this ability of yours — to detect Voldemort’s presence, even 
when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emo-
tions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since 
Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.” 
Harry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already. 
“More recently,” said Dumbledore, “I became concerned that 
Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure 
enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and 
thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the 
night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley.” 
“Yeah, Snape told me,” Harry muttered. 
“Professor Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “But 
did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why 
I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked 
at you for months?” 
Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad 
and tired. 
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “Yeah, I wondered.” 
“You see,” continued Dumbledore heavily “I believed it could not 
be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, 
to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 828  
give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realized that 
our relationship was — or had ever been — closer than that of head-
master and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to 
spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibil-
ity that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to 
think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On 
those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a 
shadow of him stir behind your eyes. . . . I was trying, in distancing 
myself from you, to protect you. An old man’s mistake . . .” 
Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in 
him, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore 
made eye contact. 
“Voldemort’s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, 
would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He 
hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would 
sacrifice you in the hope of killing him.” 
He sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He 
would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and 
now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that 
was the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered . . . 
“Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very 
night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack. I knew at 
once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had 
realized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Volde-
mort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with 
Professor Snape.” 
He paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly 
across the polished surface of Dumbledore’s desk, illuminate a silver 
ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the por-
traits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumble-
dore’s explanation. He could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the 
slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned. . . . 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 829  
“Professor Snape discovered,” Dumbledore resumed, “that you had 
been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for 
months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of 
hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body, and as he dwelled 
on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant. 
“And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of 
Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all 
along — that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily 
protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the 
shelves without suffering madness. In this case, either Voldemort him-
self would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing 
himself at last — or else you would have to take it for him. It became 
a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.” 
“But I didn’t,” muttered Harry. He said it aloud to try and ease the 
dead weight of guilt inside him; a confession must surely relieve some 
of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. “I didn’t practice, I didn’t 
bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione 
kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me 
where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t —” 
Something was erupting inside Harry’s head: a need to justify him-
self, to explain — 
“I tried to check he’d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge’s of-
fice, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said Sirius wasn’t there, he 
said he’d gone!” 
“Kreacher lied,” said Dumbledore calmly. “You are not his master, 
he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher 
intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.” 
“He — he sent me on purpose?” 
“Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one 
master for months.” 
“How?” said Harry blankly. “He hasn’t been out of Grimmauld 
Place for years.” 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 830  
“Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,” said 
Dumbledore, “when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’ 
He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the 
house. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had 
any respect left. . . . Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife 
of Lucius Malfoy.” 
“How do you know all this?” Harry said. His heart was beating very 
fast. He felt sick. He remembered worrying about Kreacher’s odd 
absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the 
attic. . . . 
“Kreacher told me last night,” said Dumbledore. “You see, when 
you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realized that you 
had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of 
Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should 
explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable 
methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s of-
fice. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grim-
mauld Place. 
“When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest 
with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still 
believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort’s. He alerted certain 
Order members at once.” 
Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said, “Alastor Moody, 
Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at 
headquarters when he made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at 
once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he 
needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had hap-
pened, for I was due there at any moment. In the meantime he, Pro-
fessor Snape, intended to search the forest for you. 
“But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to 
search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what 
had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 831  
shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told 
me — laughing fit to burst — where Sirius had gone.” 
“He was laughing?” said Harry in a hollow voice. 
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “You see, Kreacher was not able to be-
tray us totally. He is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, he could not 
give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order’s con-
fidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. He was bound by 
the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not dis-
obey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa 
information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must 
have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from 
repeating it.” 
“Like what?” said Harry. 
“Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world 
was you,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Like the fact that you were com-
ing to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort 
knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that you knew 
where he was — but Kreacher’s information made him realize that the 
one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius 
Black.” 
Harry’s lips were cold and numb. 
“So . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night . . .” 
“The Malfoys — undoubtedly on Voldemort’s instructions — had 
told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you 
had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to 
check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to 
pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yester-
day, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, 
Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.” 
There seemed to be very little air in Harry’s lungs, his breathing was 
quick and shallow. 
“And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?” he croaked. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 832  
“He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore. “But I am a suffi-
ciently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied 
to and I — persuaded him — to tell me the full story, before I left for 
the Department of Mysteries.” 
“And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, 
“and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him —” 
“She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I warned Sirius 
when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that 
Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him 
that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius 
took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with 
feelings as acute as a humans —” 
“Don’t you blame — don’t you — talk — about Sirius like —” 
Harry’s breath was constricted, he could not get the words out prop-
erly. But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again; 
he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. “Kreacher’s a lying — 
foul — he deserved —” 
“Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,” said Dum-
bledore. “Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as 
your friend Dobby’s. He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sir-
ius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no 
true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher’s faults, it must be admit-
ted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier —” 
“DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!” Harry yelled. 
He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who 
had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much 
he had suffered . . . 
“What about Snape?” Harry spat. “You’re not talking about him, 
are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me 
as usual —” 
“Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pre-
tend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,” said 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 833  
Dumbledore steadily, “but as I have explained, he informed the Order 
as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced 
where you had gone when you did not return from the forest. It was 
he too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was 
attempting to force you to tell of Sirius’s whereabouts. . . .” 
Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, 
it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted 
to hear Dumbledore agree with him. 
“Snape — Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he 
made out Sirius was a coward —” 
“Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble 
taunts to hurt him,” said Dumbledore. 
“Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!” Harry snarled. 
“He threw me out of his office!” 
“I am aware of it,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I have already said 
that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was 
sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than 
to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my 
presence —” 
“Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with 
him —” Harry remembered Ron’s thoughts on the subject and 
plunged on. “How do you know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for 
Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my —” 
“I trust Severus Snape,” said Dumbledore simply. “But I forgot — 
another old man’s mistake — that some wounds run too deep for the 
healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about 
your father — I was wrong.” 
“But that’s okay, is it?” yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces 
and disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls. “It’s 
okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate 
Kreacher?” 
“Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said Dumbledore. “He regarded 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 834  
him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference 
and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . . 
The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mis-
treated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping 
our reward.” 
“SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?” Harry 
yelled. 
“I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,” Dumbledore 
replied quietly. “Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves 
in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living 
reminder of the home Sirius had hated.” 
“Yeah, he did hate it!” said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his 
back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the 
room now, and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked, 
without realizing what he was doing, without seeing the office at all. 
“You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that’s why 
he wanted to get out last night —” 
“I was trying to keep Sirius alive,” said Dumbledore quietly. 
“People don’t like being locked up!” Harry said furiously, rounding 
on him. “You did it to me all last summer —” 
Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered 
hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaus-
tion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften 
him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was 
showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when 
Harry wanted to rage and storm at him. 
Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his 
half-moon glasses. 
“It is time,” he said, “for me to tell you what I should have told you 
five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you every-
thing. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at  
 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 835  
me — to do whatever you like — when I have finished. I will not stop 
you.” 
Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the 
chair opposite Dumbledore and waited. Dumbledore stared for a mo-
ment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at 
Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe 
and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole. 
You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and 
uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and diffi-
cult years.” 
He paused. Harry said nothing. 
“You might ask — and with good reason — why it had to be so. 
Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many 
would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and 
delighted to raise you as a son. 
“My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in 
more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had 
been vanquished hours before, but his supporters — and many of 
them are almost as terrible as he — were still at large, angry, desper-
ate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the 
years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I 
knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he re-
turned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing 
him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you. 
“I knew that Voldemort’s knowledge of magic is perhaps more ex-
tensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and 
powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if 
he ever returned to full power. 
“But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my 
decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which 
he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore,  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 836  
underestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact 
that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection 
he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I 
put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her 
sister, her only remaining relative.” 
“She doesn’t love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn’t give a 
damn —” 
“But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have 
taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took 
you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your 
mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could 
give you.” 
“I still don’t —” 
“While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood 
dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He 
shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became 
your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you 
can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. 
I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her 
doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept 
you alive for the past fifteen years.” 
“Wait,” said Harry. “Wait a moment.” 
He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore. 
“You sent that Howler. You told her to remember — it was your 
voice —” 
“I thought,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, “that she 
might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I sus-
pected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of 
having you as a surrogate son.” 
“It did,” said Harry quietly. “Well — my uncle more than her. He 
wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she — she said I  
 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 837  
had to stay.” He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, “But 
what’s this got to do with . . .” 
He could not say Sirius’s name. 
“Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had 
not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy 
nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and 
healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as 
I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was 
working well. 
“And then . . . well, you will remember the events of your first year 
at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the 
challenge that faced you, and sooner — much sooner — than I had 
anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You sur-
vived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and 
strength. You fought a man’s fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can 
say. 
“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” said Dumb-
ledore. “An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undo-
ing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan 
should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin 
it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was 
my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle 
with Voldemort.” 
“I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said Harry. 
“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, 
why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?” 
Harry nodded. 
“Ought I to have told you then?” 
Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was 
racing again. 
“You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No . . . perhaps not. Well,  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 838  
as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself, 
was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when 
you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young 
age. 
“I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have 
asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already 
asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible 
answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I 
did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young, 
much too young. 
“And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again 
you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced. Once again 
you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me 
again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you. We dis-
cussed your scar, oh yes. . . . We came very, very close to the subject. 
Why did I not tell you everything? 
“Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than 
eleven to receive such information. I allowed you to leave my pres-
ence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of 
unease that I ought, perhaps, have told you then, it was swiftly si-
lenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in me 
to spoil that night of triumph. . . . 
“Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? 
I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could 
avoid, that I must avoid.” 
“I don’t —” 
“I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared 
more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your 
peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that 
might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as 
Voldemort expects we fools who love to act. 
“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have — 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 839  
and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined — 
not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. 
What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and crea-
tures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you 
were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have 
such a person on my hands. 
“We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled 
to repel dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and res-
cued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had tri-
umphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry? 
But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young 
you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional. My con-
science was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon. . . . 
“But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric 
Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself . . . and I did 
not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do 
it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the 
knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved 
that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only 
defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens 
than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could 
not bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.” 
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak. 
“I still don’t understand.” 
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a 
prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had 
been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to 
kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the 
terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mis-
taken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his 
return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape 
from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 840  
its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously 
since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.” 
The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it. 
The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided 
gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry 
had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the 
baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes. 
“The prophecy’s smashed,” Harry said blankly. “I was pulling 
Neville up those benches in the — the room where the archway was, 
and I ripped his robes and it fell. . . .” 
“The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy 
kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to 
somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.” 
“Who heard it?” asked Harry, though he thought he knew the an-
swer already. 
“I did,” said Dumbledore. “On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, 
in a room above the bar at the Hog’s Head Inn. I had gone there to see 
an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against 
my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. 
The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very 
famous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet 
her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the 
gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she 
would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.” 
Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cab-
inet that stood beside Fawkes’s perch. He bent down, slid back a 
catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with 
runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father torment-
ing Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve 
upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew 
silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and 
deposited them in the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 841  
watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. 
Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery sub-
stance with its tip. 
A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enor-
mous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the 
basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethe-
real, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her 
use once before. 
“THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD AP-
PROACHES. . . . BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM, BORN 
AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES . . . AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK 
HIM AS HIS EQUAL, BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS 
NOT . . . AND EITHER MUST DIE AT THE HAND OF THE OTHER FOR NEI-
THER CAN LIVE WHILE THE OTHER SURVIVES. . . . THE ONE WITH THE 
POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD WILL BE BORN AS THE SEVENTH 
MONTH DIES. . . .” 
The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver 
mass below and vanished. 
The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore 
nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had 
fallen silent. 
“Professor Dumbledore?” Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, 
still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. “It . . . 
did that mean . . . What did that mean?” 
“It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only 
chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end 
of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents 
who had already defied Voldemort three times.” 
Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His 
breathing seemed difficult again. 
“It means — me?” 
Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 842  
“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have 
meant you at all. Sibyll’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard 
boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had par-
ents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly 
escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other 
was Neville Longbottom.” 
“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and 
not Neville’s?” 
“The official record was relabeled after Voldemort’s attack on you 
as a child,” said Dumbledore. “It seemed plain to the keeper of the 
Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you be-
cause he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.” 
“Then — it might not be me?” said Harry. 
“I am afraid,” said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every 
word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it is you.” 
“But you said — Neville was born at the end of July too — and his 
mum and dad —” 
“You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identi-
fying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. . . . Volde-
mort himself would ‘mark him as his equal.’ And so he did, Harry. He 
chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both 
blessing and curse.” 
“But he might have chosen wrong!” said Harry. “He might have 
marked the wrong person!” 
“He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,” 
said Dumbledore. “And notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood 
(which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being 
or knowing), but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you be-
fore he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not 
kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have 
fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far — something 
that neither your parents, nor Neville’s parents, ever achieved.” 
THE  LOST  PROPHECY 
 843  
“Why did he do it, then?” said Harry, who felt numb and cold. 
“Why did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see 
whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and 
tried to kill whoever it was then —” 
“That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,” said 
Dumbledore, “except that Voldemort’s information about the 
prophecy was incomplete. The Hog’s Head Inn, which Sibyll chose 
for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting 
clientele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found 
out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never 
safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not 
dreamed, when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney, that I would hear 
anything worth overhearing. My — our — one stroke of good for-
tune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the 
prophecy and thrown from the building.” 
“So he only heard . . . ?” 
“He heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy 
in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he 
could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk trans-
ferring power to you — again marking you as his equal. So Voldemort 
never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might 
be wise to wait or to learn more. He did not know that you would 
have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ —” 
“But I don’t!” said Harry in a strangled voice. “I haven’t any powers 
he hasn’t got, I couldn’t fight the way he did tonight, I can’t possess 
people or — or kill them —” 
“There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,” interrupted 
Dumbledore, “that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that 
is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human 
intelligence, than forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most myste-
rious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power 
held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-SEVEN 
 844  
Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. 
That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he 
could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the 
end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your 
heart that saved you.” 
Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius 
would not have died. . . . More to stave off the moment when he 
would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring 
much about the answer, “The end of the prophecy . . . it was some-
thing about . . . ‘neither can live. . . .’ ” 
“ ‘. . . while the other survives,’” said Dumbledore. 
“So,” said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep 
well of despair inside him, “so does that mean that . . . that one of us 
has got to kill the other one . . . in the end?” 
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. 
For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the 
office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading 
down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed im-
possible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, 
who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone 
forever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of 
Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would 
have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with 
his laugh like a bark. . . . 
“I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,” said Dumbledore 
hesitantly. “You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you 
as a prefect? I must confess . . . that I rather thought . . . you had 
enough responsibility to be going on with.” 
Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumble-
dore’s face into his long silver beard.

HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED RETURNS 
In a brief statement Friday night, Minister of Magic 
Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-
Not-Be Named has returned to this country and is 
active once more. 
“It is with great regret that I must confirm that the 
wizard styling himself Lord — well, you know who I 
mean — is alive and among us again,” said Fudge, 
looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters. 
“It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass 
revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown 
themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry’s em-
ploy. We believe that the dementors are currently tak-
ing direction from Lord — Thingy. 
“We urge the magical population to remain vigi-
lant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to 
elementary home and personal defense that will be 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 846  
delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the 
coming month.” 
The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and 
alarm from the Wizarding community, which as re-
cently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry as-
surances that there was “no truth whatsoever in these 
persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating 
amongst us once more.” 
Details of the events that led to the Ministry turn-
around are still hazy, though it is believed that He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select band of 
followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to 
the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening. 
Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster 
of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, re-
instated member of the International Confederation 
of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wiz-
engamot, was unavailable for comment last night. He 
has insisted for a year that You-Know-Who was not 
dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but recruit-
ing followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize 
power. Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived — 
 
“There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,” 
said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him. 
They were in the hospital wing. Harry was sitting on the end of 
Ron’s bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front 
page of the Sunday Prophet. Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in 
a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione’s 
bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size 
and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had 
dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 847  
reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a 
word Hermione was saying. 
“He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again now, though, isn’t he?” said Ron 
darkly. “Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?” 
He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the im-
mense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a few to Harry, Ginny, and 
Neville, and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth. There 
were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain’s tentacles had 
wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could 
leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had 
started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly’s Oblivious Unc-
tion, there seemed to be some improvement. 
“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, Harry,” said 
Hermione, now scanning down the article. “ ‘A lone voice of truth . . . 
perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story . . . forced to bear 
ridicule and slander . . .’ Hmmm,” said Hermione, frowning, “I notice 
they don’t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing 
and slandering, though. . . .” 
She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov 
had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he 
been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in 
Madam Pomfrey’s words, “quite enough damage to be going on with.” 
Hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day 
and although she was improving greatly, was already bored with the 
hospital wing. 
“ ‘You-Know-Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What 
the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Al-
bus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Pot-
ter, page nine . . .’ Well,” said Hermione, folding up the newspaper 
and throwing it aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about. 
And that interview with Harry isn’t exclusive, it’s the one that was in 
The Quibbler months ago. . . .” 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 848  
“Daddy sold it to them,” said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The 
Quibbler. “He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on 
an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a 
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.” 
Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said, 
“That sounds lovely.” 
Ginny caught Harry’s eye and looked away quickly, grinning. 
“So anyway,” said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and winc-
ing again, “what’s going on in school?” 
“Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said Ginny. 
“He did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the 
window and he’s roped it off —” 
“Why?” said Hermione, looking startled. 
“Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,” said Ginny, 
shrugging. 
“I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,” said Ron 
through a mouthful of chocolate. “They sent me all these, you know,” 
he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him. 
“Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?” 
Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, “So has all the 
trouble stopped now Dumbledore’s back?” 
“Yes,” said Neville, “everything’s settled right back down again.” 
“I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?” asked Ron, propping a Chocolate 
Frog card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug. 
“Not at all,” said Ginny. “He’s really, really miserable, actually. . . .” 
She lowered her voice to a whisper. “He keeps saying Umbridge was 
the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts. . . .” 
All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a 
bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode 
alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs. How he had 
done it — how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor 
Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him — nobody knew, and 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 849  
Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the cas-
tle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. No-
body really knew what was wrong with her either. Her usually neat 
mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it, 
but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed. 
“Madam Pomfrey says she’s just in shock,” whispered Hermione. 
“Sulking, more like,” said Ginny 
“Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,” said Ron, and with his 
tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, 
looking wildly around. 
“Anything wrong, Professor?” called Madam Pomfrey, poking her 
head around her office door. 
“No . . . no . . .” said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows, 
“no, I must have been dreaming. . . .” 
Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes. 
“Speaking of centaurs,” said Hermione, when she had recovered a 
little, “who’s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?” 
“He’s got to,” said Harry, “the other centaurs won’t take him back, 
will they?” 
“It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,” said 
Ginny. 
“Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for 
good,” said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. “Mind you, 
the whole subjects useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better. . . .” 
“How can you say that?” Hermione demanded. “After we’ve just 
found out that there are real prophecies?” 
Harry’s heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione, or 
anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them 
it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death 
Room, and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not 
ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be ei-
ther murderer or victim, there was no other way. . . . 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 850  
“It is a pity it broke,” said Hermione quietly, shaking her head. 
“Yeah, it is,” said Ron. “Still, at least You-Know-Who never found 
out what was in it either — where are you going?” he added, looking 
both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up. 
“Er — Hagrid’s,” said Harry. “You know, he just got back and I 
promised I’d go down and see him and tell him how you two are. . . .” 
“Oh all right then,” said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormi-
tory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. “Wish we could 
come . . .” 
“Say hello to him for us!” called Hermione, as Harry proceeded 
down the ward. “And ask him what’s happening about . . . about his 
little friend!” 
Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and under-
stood as he left the dormitory. 
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was 
clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and 
the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by studying or 
homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering 
out of windows as he went. He could see people messing around in 
the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming 
in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid. 
He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted 
to be with people or not. Whenever he was in company he wanted to 
get away, and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought 
he might really go and visit Hagrid, though; he had not talked to him 
properly since he had returned. . . . 
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall 
when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right 
that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry 
stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. For a few moments, the 
only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the 
hall from the grounds through the open front doors. 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 851  
Malfoy glanced around. Harry knew he was checking for signs of 
teachers. Then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, 
“You’re dead, Potter.” 
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Funny,” he said, “you’d think I’d have 
stopped walking around. . . .” 
Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind 
of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted 
with rage. 
“You’re going to pay,” said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a 
whisper. “I’m going to make you pay for what you’ve done to my 
father. . . .” 
“Well, I’m terrified now,” said Harry sarcastically. “I s’pose Lord 
Voldemort’s just a warm-up act compared to you three — what’s the 
matter?” he said, for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked 
stricken at the sound of the name. “He’s your dad’s mate, isn’t he? Not 
scared of him, are you?” 
“You think you’re such a big man, Potter,” said Malfoy, advancing 
now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. “You wait. I’ll have you. You 
can’t land my father in prison —” 
“I thought I just had,” said Harry. 
“The dementors have left Azkaban,” said Malfoy quietly. “Dad and 
the others’ll be out in no time. . . .” 
“Yeah, I expect they will,” said Harry. “Still, at least everyone 
knows what scumbags they are now —” 
Malfoy’s hand flew toward his wand, but Harry was too quick for 
him. He had drawn his own wand before Malfoy’s fingers had even 
entered the pocket of his robes. 
“Potter!” 
The voice rang across the entrance hall; Snape had emerged from the 
staircase leading down to his office, and at the sight of him Harry felt a 
great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt toward Malfoy. . . . What-
ever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . . . never . . . 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 852  
“What are you doing, Potter?” said Snape coldly as ever, as he 
strode over to the four of them. 
“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,” said Harry 
fiercely. 
Snape stared at him. 
“Put that wand away at once,” he said curtly. “Ten points from 
Gryff —” 
Snape looked toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a 
sneering smile. 
“Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-
glass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to —” 
“Add some more?” 
Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the 
castle. She was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning 
heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite 
well. 
“Professor McGonagall!” said Snape, striding forward. “Out of St. 
Mungo’s, I see!” 
“Yes, Professor Snape,” said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off 
her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new. You two — Crabbe — 
Goyle —” 
She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling 
their large feet and looking awkward. 
“Here,” said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into 
Crabbe’s chest and her cloak into Goyle’s, “take these up to my office 
for me.” 
They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase. 
“Right then,” said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hour-
glasses on the wall, “well, I think Potter and his friends ought to have 
fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-
Who! What say you, Professor Snape?” 
 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 853  
“What?” snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard per-
fectly well. “Oh — well — I suppose . . .” 
“So that’s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and 
Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell 
down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor’s hourglass as she spoke. 
“Oh — and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,” she added, and a 
number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw’s glass. “Now, you wanted to 
take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape — so there we 
are. . . .” 
A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable 
amount below nevertheless. 
“Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious 
day like this,” Professor McGonagall continued briskly. 
Harry did not need telling twice. He thrust his wand back inside 
his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another 
glance at Snape and Malfoy. 
The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns 
toward Hagrid’s cabin. Students lying around on the grass sun-
bathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet, and eating sweets 
looked up at him as he passed. Some called out to him, or else 
waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided 
he was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He 
had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days 
ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it 
that way. 
He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid’s cabin door that 
he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and al-
most bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it 
transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden. 
“All righ’, Harry!” he said, beaming, when Harry approached the 
fence. “Come in, come in, we’ll have a cup o’ dandelion juice. . . . 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 854  
“How’s things?” Hagrid asked him, as they settled down at his 
wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. “You — er — feelin’ all 
righ’, are yeh?” 
Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid’s face that he was 
not referring to Harry’s physical well-being. 
“I’m fine,” Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss 
the thing that he knew was in Hagrid’s mind. “So, where’ve you 
been?” 
“Bin hidin’ out in the mountains,” said Hagrid. “Up in a cave, like 
Sirius did when he —” 
Hagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and 
took a long draft of juice. 
“Anyway, back now,” he said feebly. 
“You — you look better,” said Harry, who was determined to keep 
the conversation moving away from Sirius. 
“Wha?” said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face. 
“Oh — oh yeah. Well, Grawpy’s loads better behaved now, loads. 
Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. 
He’s a good lad, really. . . . I’ve bin thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find him a 
lady friend, actually. . . .” 
Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this 
idea at once. The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the 
forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was posi-
tively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy nec-
essary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again, 
and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large 
gulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass. 
“Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now, Harry,” said Ha-
grid softly and unexpectedly. “Tha’s gotta be better, hasn’ it?” 
Harry shrugged. 
“Look . . .” Hagrid leaned toward him across the table, “I knew  
 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 855  
Sirius longer ’n you did. . . . He died in battle, an’ tha’s the way he’d’ve 
wanted ter go —” 
“He didn’t want to go at all!” said Harry angrily. 
Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head. 
“Nah, I don’ reckon he did,” he said quietly. “But still, Harry . . . he 
was never one ter sit around at home an’ let other people do the fightin’. 
He couldn’ have lived with himself if he hadn’ gone ter help —” 
Harry leapt up again. 
“I’ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,” 
he said mechanically. 
“Oh,” said Hagrid, looking rather upset. “Oh . . . all righ then, 
Harry . . . Take care of yerself then, an’ drop back in if yeh’ve got a 
mo. . . .” 
“Yeah . . . right . . .” 
Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open. He 
was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying good-
bye and walked away across the lawn. Once again, people called out 
to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing 
they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself 
alone in the grounds. . . . 
A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the 
vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given al-
most anything for the Wizarding world to know that he had been 
telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back and 
know that he was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however . . . 
He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, shel-
tered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared 
out over the gleaming water, thinking. . . . 
Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt 
isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible 
barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was — he had  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 856  
always been — a marked man. It was just that he had never really un-
derstood what that meant. . . . 
And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight 
of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, 
he could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the 
grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he 
felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it 
was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include, 
or end in, murder. . . . 
He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to 
think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across 
from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had collapsed trying to 
fend off a hundred dementors. . . . 
The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold. He got up 
and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went. 
 
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days 
before the end of term. Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk 
about Sirius, but Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she 
mentioned his name. Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to 
talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood. He 
knew one thing, though: Unhappy as he felt at the moment, he would 
greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days’ time when he was back at num-
ber four, Privet Drive. Even though he now understood exactly why 
he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about 
it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more. 
Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. 
It seemed that she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinner-
time, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for 
her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as 
Fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises,  
 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 857  
whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. 
Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running 
away down the path, and the Heads of Houses tried only halfheart-
edly to restrain their pupils. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back 
into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and 
was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering af-
ter Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick. 
Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished pack-
ing and were already heading down to the end-of-term feast, but 
Harry had not even started. 
“Just do it tomorrow!” said Ron, who was waiting by the door of 
their dormitory. “Come on, I’m starving. . . .” 
“I won’t be long. . . . Look, you go ahead. . . .” 
But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no ef-
fort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to 
attend the end-of-term feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would 
make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention 
Voldemort’s return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all. . . . 
Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his 
trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly 
wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it 
was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his 
trainers, and examined it. 
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him 
just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. Use it if you need  
me, all right? 
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out 
fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry 
held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him. 
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled 
note from Sirius. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 858  
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. 
If you need to speak to me, just say my name 
into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be 
able to talk in yours. James and I used to use 
them when we were in separate detentions. 
 
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead 
parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able 
to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it — 
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the 
dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in 
front of his face with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, 
“Sirius.” 
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even 
closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at 
him through the fog were definitely his own. 
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang 
clearly through the room, “Sirius Black!” 
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the 
mirror was still, definitely, his own. . . . 
Sirius didn’t have his mirror on him when he went through the arch-
way, said a small voice in Harry’s head. That’s why it’s not working. . . . 
Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror 
back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a 
whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him 
again. . . . 
Disappointment was burning in his throat. He got up and began 
throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken 
mirror — 
But then an idea struck him. . . . A better idea than a mirror . . . A  
 
THE  SECOND

much bigger, more important idea . . . How had he never thought of 
it before — why had he never asked? 
He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral stair-
case, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing. He hurtled across 
the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the 
corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him, “The feast is 
about to start, you know, you’re cutting it very fine!” 
But Harry had no intention of going to the feast . . . 
How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you 
didn’t need one, yet now . . . 
He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either 
alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his 
Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconso-
lately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the 
feast . . . 
But just as he had given up hope he saw it — a translucent some-
body drifting across the end of the corridor. 
“Hey — hey Nick! NICK!” 
The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extrav-
agantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de 
Mimsy-Porpington. 
“Good evening,” he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the 
solid stone and smiling at Harry. “I am not the only one who is late, 
then? Though,” he sighed, “in rather different senses, of course . . .” 
“Nick, can I ask you something?” 
A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick’s face as 
he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little 
straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only 
when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely. 
“Er — now, Harry?” said Nick, looking discomforted. “Can’t it 
wait until after the feast?” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 860  
“No — Nick — please,” said Harry, “I really need to talk to you. 
Can we go in here?” 
Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Head-
less Nick sighed. 
“Oh very well,” he said, looking resigned. “I can’t pretend I haven’t 
been expecting it.” 
Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through 
the wall instead. 
“Expecting what?” Harry asked, as he closed the door. 
“You to come and find me,” said Nick, now gliding over to the win-
dow and looking out at the darkening grounds. “It happens, some-
times . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss.” 
“Well,” said Harry, refusing to be deflected. “You were right, 
I’ve — I’ve come to find you.” 
Nick said nothing. 
“It’s —” said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had 
anticipated, “it’s just — you’re dead. But you’re still here, aren’t you?” 
Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds. 
“That’s right, isn’t it?” Harry urged him. “You died, but I’m talking 
to you. . . . You can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can’t you?” 
“Yes,” said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, “I walk and talk, yes.” 
“So, you came back, didn’t you?” said Harry urgently. “People can 
come back, right? As ghosts. They don’t have to disappear completely. 
Well ?” he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing. 
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, “Not everyone can come 
back as a ghost.” 
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. 
“Only . . . only wizards.” 
“Oh,” said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. “Well, that’s 
okay then, the person I’m asking about is a wizard. So he can come 
back, right?” 
 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 861  
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at 
Harry. “He won’t come back.” 
“Who?” 
“Sirius Black,” said Nick. 
“But you did!” said Harry angrily. “You came back — you’re dead 
and you didn’t disappear —” 
“Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to 
walk palely where their living selves once trod,” said Nick miserably. 
“But very few wizards choose that path.” 
“Why not?” said Harry. “Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius 
won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!” 
And so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to 
check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, 
pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward 
him. 
“He will not come back,” repeated Nick quietly. “He will have . . . 
gone on.” 
“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” said Harry quickly. “Gone on 
where? Listen — what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you 
go? Why doesn’t everyone come back? Why isn’t this place full of 
ghosts? Why — ?” 
“I cannot answer,” said Nick. 
“You’re dead, aren’t you?” said Harry exasperatedly. “Who can an-
swer better than you?” 
“I was afraid of death,” said Nick. “I chose to remain behind. I 
sometimes wonder whether I oughtn’t to have . . . Well, that is neither 
here nor there. . . . In fact, I am neither here nor there. . . .” He gave 
a small sad chuckle. “I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for 
I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards 
study the matter in the Department of Mysteries —” 
“Don’t talk to me about that place!” said Harry fiercely. 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 862  
“I am sorry not to have been more help,” said Nick gently. “Well 
. . . well, do excuse me . . . the feast, you know . . .” 
And he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at 
the wall through which Nick had disappeared. 
Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again 
in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once 
more. He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty 
castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again. 
He had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady’s corridor when he 
saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A sec-
ond glance showed him that it was Luna. There were no good hiding 
places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any 
case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the 
moment. 
“Hello,” said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped 
back from the notice. 
“How come you’re not at the feast?” Harry asked. 
“Well, I’ve lost most of my possessions,” said Luna serenely. “Peo-
ple take them and hide them, you know. But as it’s the last night, I re-
ally do need them back, so I’ve been putting up signs.” 
She gestured toward the notice board, upon which, sure enough, 
she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea 
for their return. 
An odd feeling rose in Harry — an emotion quite different from 
the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius’s death. It was a few 
moments before he realized that he was feeling sorry for Luna. 
“How come people hide your stuff?” he asked her, frowning. 
“Oh . . . well . . .” She shrugged. “I think they think I’m a bit odd, 
you know. Some people call me ‘Loony’ Lovegood, actually.” 
Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather 
painfully. 
 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 863  
“That’s no reason for them to take your things,” he said flatly. 
“D’you want help finding them?” 
“Oh no,” she said, smiling at him. “They’ll come back, they always 
do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway . . . 
why aren’t you at the feast?” 
Harry shrugged. “Just didn’t feel like it.” 
“No,” said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuber-
ant eyes. “I don’t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed 
was your godfather, wasn’t he? Ginny told me.” 
Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not 
mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she too 
could see thestrals. 
“Have you . . .” he began. “I mean, who . . . has anyone you’ve 
known ever died?” 
“Yes,” said Luna simply, “my mother. She was a quite extraordinary 
witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells 
went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.” 
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled. 
“Yes, it was rather horrible,” said Luna conversationally. “I still feel 
very sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad. And anyway, it’s 
not as though I’ll never see Mum again, is it?” 
“Er — isn’t it?” said Harry uncertainly. 
She shook her head in disbelief. “Oh, come on. You heard them, 
just behind the veil, didn’t you?” 
“You mean . . .” 
“In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of 
sight, that’s all. You heard them.” 
They looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not 
know what to say, or to think. Luna believed so many extraordinary 
things . . . yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil 
too. . . . 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 864  
“Are you sure you don’t want me to help you look for your stuff?” 
he said. 
“Oh no,” said Luna. “No, I think I’ll just go down and have some 
pudding and wait for it all to turn up. . . . It always does in the end. 
. . . Well, have a nice holiday, Harry.” 
“Yeah . . . yeah, you too.” 
She walked away from him, and as he watched her go, he found that 
the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly. 
 
The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in 
several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been 
waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher wit-
nesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he 
made his way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded 
had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the at-
tack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw 
what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to 
Harry’s aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan 
Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot 
had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had 
taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much 
as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry, 
Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them 
there to ooze. 
“I must say, I’m looking forward to seeing Malfoy’s mother’s face 
when he gets off the train,” said Ernie with some satisfaction, as he 
watched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the 
indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief 
spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad. 
“Goyle’s mum’ll be really pleased, though,” said Ron, who had 
come to investigate the source of the commotion. “He’s loads better- 
 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 865  
looking now. . . . Anyway, Harry, the food trolley’s just stopped if you 
want anything. . . .” 
Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their 
compartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and 
Pumpkin Pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again, 
Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and Neville was stroking his 
Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year 
and now made odd crooning noises when touched. 
Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard 
chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet. It was now 
full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Min-
istry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that 
the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very 
morning. . . . 
“It hasn’t really started yet,” sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up 
the newspaper again. “But it won’t be long now. . . .” 
“Hey, Harry,” said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the 
corridor. 
Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta 
Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho’s eyes met for 
a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down 
at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its 
square by Ron’s knight. 
“What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway?” Ron asked 
quietly. 
“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully. 
“I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now,” said 
Hermione tentatively. 
Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at 
all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no 
longer quite connected with him. So much of what he had wanted  
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 866  
before Sirius’s death felt that way these days. . . . The week that had 
elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, 
much longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in 
it, and the one without. 
“You’re well out of it, mate,” said Ron forcefully. “I mean, she’s 
quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more 
cheerful.” 
“She’s probably cheerful enough with someone else,” said Harry, 
shrugging. 
“Who’s she with now anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, but it was 
Ginny who answered. 
“Michael Corner,” she said. 
“Michael — but —” said Ron, craning around in his seat to stare 
at her. “But you were going out with him!” 
“Not anymore,” said Ginny resolutely. “He didn’t like Gryffindor 
beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him 
and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.” She scratched her nose ab-
sently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside down, 
and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted. 
“Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,” he said, prodding 
his queen forward toward Harry’s quivering castle. “Good for you. 
Just choose someone — better — next time.” 
He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it. 
“Well, I’ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he’s better?” asked 
Ginny vaguely. 
“WHAT?” shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks 
went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered 
and hooted angrily from overhead. 
As the train slowed down in the approach to King’s Cross, Harry 
thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleet-
ingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained  
 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 867  
stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would 
take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, 
however, he lifted down Hedwig’s cage and prepared to drag his trunk 
from the train as usual. 
When the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione 
that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms 
nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other 
side: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not 
expected at all. 
There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his 
bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done 
without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped 
in a voluminous traveling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her 
bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering 
through the dirty glass station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans 
and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend the weird sisters. 
Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair graying, a long and 
threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the 
front of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Mug-
gle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new 
jackets in some lurid green, scaly material. 
“Ron, Ginny!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward and hugging 
her children tightly. “Oh, and Harry dear — how are you?” 
“Fine,” lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her 
shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins’ new clothes. 
“What are they supposed to be?” he asked, pointing at the jackets. 
“Finest dragon skin, little bro,” said Fred, giving his zip a little 
tweak. “Business is booming and we thought we’d treat ourselves.” 
“Hello, Harry,” said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry and 
turned to greet Hermione. 
“Hi,” said Harry. “I didn’t expect . . . what are you all doing here?” 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 868  
“Well,” said Lupin with a slight smile, “we thought we might have 
a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you 
home.” 
“I dunno if that’s a good idea,” said Harry at once. 
“Oh, I think it is,” growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. 
“That’ll be them, will it, Potter?” 
He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was 
evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat. 
Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was point-
ing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked 
positively appalled to see Harry’s reception committee. 
“Ah, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione’s parents, 
whom he had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in 
turns to hug Hermione. “Well — shall we do it, then?” 
“Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,” said Moody. 
He and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station toward the 
place where the Dursleys stood, apparently rooted to the floor. 
Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the 
group. 
“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon, 
coming to a halt right in front of him. “You might remember me, my 
name’s Arthur Weasley.” 
As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Durs-
leys’ living room two years previously, Harry would have been very 
surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle 
Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but 
chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were 
outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and 
embarrassed. She kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody 
she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed 
to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was fail-
ing extravagantly. 
THE  SECOND 
WAR  BEGINS 
 869  
“We thought we’d just have a few words with you about Harry,” 
said Mr. Weasley, still smiling. 
“Yeah,” growled Moody. “About how he’s treated when he’s at your 
place.” 
Uncle Vernon’s mustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possi-
bly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression 
that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to 
Moody. 
“I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my 
house —” 
“I expect what you’re not aware of would fill several books, Durs-
ley,” growled Moody. 
“Anyway, that’s not the point,” interjected Tonks, whose pink hair 
seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for 
she closed her eyes rather than look at her. “The point is, if we find 
out you’ve been horrible to Harry —” 
“— and make no mistake, we’ll hear about it,” added Lupin 
pleasantly. 
“Yes,” said Mr. Weasley, “even if you won’t let Harry use the 
fellytone —” 
“Telephone,” whispered Hermione. 
“Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter’s been mistreated in any way, 
you’ll have us to answer to,” said Moody. 
Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to 
outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs. 
“Are you threatening me, sir?” he said, so loudly that passersby ac-
tually turned to stare. 
“Yes, I am,” said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle 
Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly. 
“And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?” 
barked Uncle Vernon. 
“Well . . .” said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT 
 870  
sinisterly revolving magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backward in hor-
ror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. “Yes, I’d have to say 
you do, Dursley.” 
He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry. “So, Potter . . . give us a 
shout if you need us. If we don’t hear from you for three days in a row, 
we’ll send someone along. . . .” 
Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer 
that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught 
sight of these people marching up the garden path. 
“ ’Bye, then, Potter,” said Moody, grasping Harry’s shoulder for a 
moment with a gnarled hand. 
“Take care, Harry,” said Lupin quietly. “Keep in touch.” 
“Harry, we’ll have you away from there as soon as we can,” Mrs. 
Weasley whispered, hugging him again. 
“We’ll see you soon, mate,” said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry’s 
hand. 
“Really soon, Harry,” said Hermione earnestly. “We promise.” 
Harry nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them 
what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead 
he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way 
out of the station toward the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt 
Petunia, and Dudley hurrying along in his wake.
